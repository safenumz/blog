<h1 id="oil-at-100">Oil at $100</h1>

<p>I don’t know how long it’ll take to come down but clearly the momentum is down on inflation.</p>

<p>Yes they are coming down but I think are very far away from the Fed’s objective.</p>

<p>We look at other measures of inflation.</p>

<p>There’s still a lot of work for the Fed to do with the economy slowing and inflation is coming down after they want to be sure they are on the right track.</p>

<p>I think the Fed looks at this has been as the beginning of of their battle and having been more credible but having more work to do.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Good morning everyone.</p>

<p>Jonathan Ferro.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Tom Keene.</p>

<p>Thank you for being with us on a Friday.</p>

<p>On radio.</p>

<p>On television Lisa.</p>

<p>There it is again.</p>

<p>One hundred dollars a barrel on Brent crude.</p>

<p>And this comes after mixed reports yesterday.</p>

<p>This to me I find that yes he had the IAEA coming out and saying they actually expect increased demand for oil.</p>

<p>And then you had OPEC coming out and saying that they expect a surplus.</p>

<p>The market has voted with the IEA.</p>

<p>They are not necessarily taking the OPEC view on its face.</p>

<p>Commerzbank I thought did a great job out of Frankfurt on this on this mixed nature that Lisa talks about.</p>

<p>Stephen Schork joining us here I believe it was yesterday.</p>

<p>Lisa he says Henry Hub in New York surges was the word to use.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And he partly though he sees this weakening in demand.</p>

<p>This is the big debate.</p>

<p>Is this signal or is this noise.</p>

<p>Is this signaling something that is negative in the economy that goes beyond just the technicals of oil.</p>

<p>And that is not only what what Stephen Schork said but also Mandy’s.</p>

<p>You have Credit Suisse coming out and saying she views this as a symptom of the slowing demand of the decline that you’re seeing in our mental good economy.</p>

<p>And while it might be spinning but this is the demand side of the equation that’s weakening that so many people have been betting on.</p>

<p>I was a raging debate today and clearly I love with Thomas Vargas says over Peavy Yemen are right up on nat gas.</p>

<p>It’s simple.</p>

<p>Oil is attached to the surge that we see in equities reaffirmed this morning.</p>

<p>And what a surge in has been Tom I mean the Nasdaq 100 an index full of big tech stocks that have performed really badly in the first half and seen this remarkable renaissance.</p>

<p>It’s up four weeks in a row potentially if it closes out the week in positive territory.</p>

<p>That’s the longest winning streak going back to November of last year.</p>

<p>Tom equity markets rallying at a time that the Fed would like to see financial conditions tightening not loosening.</p>

<p>Where does that leave us.</p>

<p>Lisa one final question.</p>

<p>Before the data and it’s simple is the bond market is confused as the oil microeconomic market while the bond market is following the same logic that the oil market perhaps is following if you view it from the demand side.</p>

<p>If you view it from this cooling inflation story.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Basically you saw the biggest inflow into investment grade credit going back to September of 2021.</p>

<p>In this past week people are flooding back to bonds.</p>

<p>They’re flooding back to equities.</p>

<p>This is a disinflationary story.</p>

<p>This is a Fed that’s moving away from the hawkish tilt story.</p>

<p>And this is a feeling that we can achieve soft landing.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting Friday.</p>

<p>We’re going to give you a reprisal here for three hours or more with good guess.</p>

<p>We’re going to get to Ron Temple in our own here.</p>

<p>But all I can say is really an extraordinary Friday to stagger on to Jackson Hole really beginning to prepare our coverage of Jackson Hole.</p>

<p>Some wonderful guests scheduled to be with us.</p>

<p>Their futures up 21 Dow futures up 150.</p>

<p>We’re not quite back on a futures basis to where we were with the enthusiasms of yesterday but nevertheless a lift.</p>

<p>The VIX shows it with a 20 level twenty point zero eight in the bond space.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to say.</p>

<p>Yields are all over the place three point to 1 percent and the 2 year yield curve inversion less inverted than before the CPI report.</p>

<p>We’ve moved from negative 49 basis points to negative 33 basis points a dollar churning here and I guess with Euro 1 0 2 ninety six really showing the definition of churning I should note Sterling 121 42.</p>

<p>Some huge challenges in Britain and France on wildfires and on drought.</p>

<p>There’s never a drought in the brief.</p>

<p>The brief is always rich with information.</p>

<p>On a Friday she’s awake.</p>

<p>Rameau I am awake.</p>

<p>And I want to say yesterday we talked about that ten year auction and it was actually really dramatic and it was part of the pivot yesterday in markets with yields higher and stocks lower.</p>

<p>We will get to that later in the show.</p>

<p>10 AM watching University of Michigan sentiment survey.</p>

<p>Yes we’re watching the headline number which perhaps could rebound just a touch from what has been an incredible march downward.</p>

<p>How much is this really being driven by oil prices and how much do you see that reflected in the five to 10 year forecast of inflation that they put out as part of this survey.</p>

<p>I know if John Farrow were here Tom Keene would come out and say how many people do they survey.</p>

<p>Why have I never been surveyed.</p>

<p>And we’d question whether this is just a signal or whether this is something to really hinge on.</p>

<p>12:00 p.m.</p>

<p>USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Report.</p>

<p>This will be fascinating at a time when we just saw food prices surge the most going back to 1979.</p>

<p>That to me was one of the biggest.</p>

<p>Aways from the CPI report.</p>

<p>What are the supplies going to look like and this goes to the weather disruptions that we’ve seen over in Europe but also in the United States.</p>

<p>It has been really dry.</p>

<p>How much does that really crimp production of wheat of soybeans of corn.</p>

<p>And then on Sunday Saudi Aramco is going to be reporting earnings.</p>

<p>The expectation could be that perhaps it will double its profits in the wake of what we’re seeing in oil prices.</p>

<p>Tom what do we get in terms of an issue with respect to the supply the oversupply that OPEC is talking about.</p>

<p>They could see a potential surplus.</p>

<p>Do we see that in the earnings.</p>

<p>We see that in the guidance from Saudi Aramco with oil.</p>

<p>But also it’s going to move over to NASDAQ natural gas which avoid said mislabeled as just simply should be called methane which is really what it is Lisa.</p>

<p>And natural gas is front and center.</p>

<p>Huge amount of noise out of the war in Ukraine when TGIF in Netherlands is doing.</p>

<p>But the U.S.</p>

<p>surge in energy one is just really a shock.</p>

<p>And it comes also as we deal with the heat wave that we’re seeing across America.</p>

<p>And we’re also trying to export some to Europe.</p>

<p>A real confluence of events toxic brew the toxic brew made in Kailey Leinz is not used to.</p>

<p>When we talk about toxic brew the 5:00 a.m.</p>

<p>hour is toxic brew free.</p>

<p>Ron Temple makes us smarter this morning.</p>

<p>Go ahead.</p>

<p>A multifaceted head with Lazard Asset Management.</p>

<p>And Ron I want to cut right to the equity paragraph and you’re always crystal clear note which is you are focused on the grand conundrum into next year which is measuring the persistency of cash flow the persistency of free cash flow.</p>

<p>How do you actually do that.</p>

<p>Well this is all about doing the bottom up fundamental analysis Tom I’m sure you’re familiar with that mean looking out and trying to understand what makes a company generate high returns on capital and what are the drivers of whether that return on capital can stay high or whether it declines.</p>

<p>And so we’re really focused here in terms of you know what I’m looking at in the equity market is trying to avoid the speculative growth stocks that are all about earnings that might come down the pike say 5 7 10 years where all of the value of the companies in that terminal value.</p>

<p>And it’s much more vulnerable to higher discount rates and avoiding the deep value cyclical stocks that are most at risk if you have a recession and sticking right in the middle of that kind of continuum on the quality stocks the companies with high returns on capital that are pricing power brand advantages strong management strong balance sheets and that’s where you really want to do the work to understand what makes a company so strong and how they can maintain that position over time.</p>

<p>Robert we’ve heard this before from other people who are trying to gird for a recession but it feels like the mood shifted this week.</p>

<p>Have you shifted anything about your thesis in the heels of the CPI report and PPA and even what we’re seeing in terms of Fed funds teachers.</p>

<p>I think the market is reacting to the positive sign that we’ve probably seen the peak in inflation.</p>

<p>We’ve finally seen inflation roll over and it’s more of those cyclical items.</p>

<p>The items that we all thought were transitory about a year ago that are rolling over.</p>

<p>If you look at the decline and CPI that we saw this week from last month from June to July 25 basis points of the 40 basis point deceleration was cars and airfare.</p>

<p>So those are factors that we knew would roll over at some point.</p>

<p>What I’m really watching is rent of shelter.</p>

<p>What I’m watching is wage growth.</p>

<p>And so I think investors should be careful because you know as I listen to you for the last few minutes I think there is a propensity in the market to say OK this story’s over.</p>

<p>We’re gonna go back to the old playbook.</p>

<p>The Fed won’t have to raise rates as much.</p>

<p>And I can buy these companies that are growth the kind of call options.</p>

<p>I don’t think that’s the right call.</p>

<p>I think we’re in the midst of a paradigm shift on inflation.</p>

<p>And when inflation does settle I think it’s going to settle with a three handle not a one and a half to two percent like we saw for the decade into 20 19.</p>

<p>So I would be a little a lot more careful than I think I’m seeing in the markets of kind of overreacting to data in the short term.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>So Ron if you’re more careful does that mean you still view what we’ve seen as more of a bear market rally than a bonafide sustainable rally.</p>

<p>I do still believe it’s a bear market rally.</p>

<p>Man I could always be proven wrong.</p>

<p>We always have that risk.</p>

<p>But when I look at us I think we need to wait for data next month.</p>

<p>I expect CPI to come down again.</p>

<p>I’m very interested to see the job numbers.</p>

<p>There’s there are mixed signals in the job market.</p>

<p>We had a great payroll number last Friday.</p>

<p>But if you look at the JOLTS state of the job opening labor turnover survey we’ve seen a million jobs decrease in the number of unfilled positions in the last two months.</p>

<p>Now again that data is a month lagged relative to payroll data.</p>

<p>But what I want to see is are those unfilled jobs going away.</p>

<p>Which then means labor has less negotiating power which then means you’re less likely to see wage growth which is less likely than to pass through to prices going up for goods and services.</p>

<p>So so I think we need to watch more data.</p>

<p>But right now I think this is a bear market rally as a base case assumption.</p>

<p>And again I would be careful of running back to the playbook that worked for the last 10 15 years because I think that playbook should probably be thrown out around the temple if we throw out quality large cap stocks which is the mantra right now wrong and read about it five times this weekend.</p>

<p>What is the new mantra going to be.</p>

<p>Well to be careful I think quality is the playbook you want.</p>

<p>I think the playbook for the last 10 15 years that worked was by the call option by the company.</p>

<p>That is a really cool business plan that’s getting access to capital at zero interest rates unlimited capital with our gear.</p>

<p>I think that’s going to be much tougher.</p>

<p>So it’s that end of the spectrum I think is more at risk.</p>

<p>I think quality.</p>

<p>It’s interesting Don there’s been a Venn diagram overlap right.</p>

<p>Where a lot of the quality and the growth where the same company.</p>

<p>I still like the quality growth companies.</p>

<p>They know there’s companies that can generate high cash flow and grow.</p>

<p>Well that’s great if they’re at the right valuation.</p>

<p>Ronald Temple thing.</p>

<p>The good news is by the way the valuations have come down.</p>

<p>So thank you.</p>

<p>Well they have.</p>

<p>Ronald Temple thank you so much for starting us off.</p>

<p>Strong Lazard Asset manager at least I think it’s a conundrum.</p>

<p>And into the weekend I’m fascinated to see what the different shops do with their equity calls and particularly how what I’m going to call the gloom crew Fortress Bramwell.</p>

<p>I’m really pleased to see the team Lisa.</p>

<p>Yes it’s a lot like how they do a nuance here.</p>

<p>Like do they take us VIX up 100 points.</p>

<p>I mean I don’t know.</p>

<p>What they do given is Mr.</p>

<p>Temple says a bear market rally.</p>

<p>Well manage you of Credit Suisse yesterday was on Bloomberg Television and she was saying she is not on my property.</p>

<p>She’s got she’s she’s a gloom she’s a gloom crew member.</p>

<p>And she does see stocks going down.</p>

<p>But she says that this rally could continue because of oil prices weakening.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>And because that’s really been the fuel for so out of this.</p>

<p>So to speak.</p>

<p>I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Ninety nine.</p>

<p>Ninety five.</p>

<p>I’m Brent crude is not weakening.</p>

<p>Oil price went as a kid.</p>

<p>You were pumping 44 cents a gallon.</p>

<p>Gas Brent crude at one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Stay where this this is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word answers can get better.</p>

<p>FBI agents reportedly searched Donald Trump’s Florida home for classified documents related to nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>That’s according to The Washington Post.</p>

<p>The newspaper says people familiar with the probe didn’t say if the documents were recovered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed.</p>

<p>No man’s land that President Biden is preparing to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections.</p>

<p>That sets up a potential we match with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Those close to President Biden describe him as upbeat about recent legislative economic and foreign policy victories.</p>

<p>Polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate.</p>

<p>San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley says the cooler inflation reading for July is welcome and she believes it may be appropriate for the Fed to lower its interest rate increases to 50 basis points next month.</p>

<p>Still Daley told Bloomberg TV the fight against inflation is far from over.</p>

<p>She says rate hikes need to be dependent on data.</p>

<p>Three of China’s biggest state owned companies plan to delist from U.S.</p>

<p>exchanges.</p>

<p>That’s fallout from a dispute over whether American regulators should be allowed to inspect audits of Chinese businesses that are listed in the U.S..</p>

<p>That search was a premises located in Florida belonging to the former president.</p>

<p>Whatever your politics these are delicacies of classified material.</p>

<p>We’re going to dive into that right now here with futures up 16 Dow futures up one away.</p>

<p>I’m in a corner lift to the market on a Friday.</p>

<p>We’ll see where we go.</p>

<p>Here’s we just to the weekend we note Brent crude punching him a hundred dollars a barrel moments ago.</p>

<p>But the focus on Washington this weekend it’s sort of difficult to imagine how we get to the Sunday talk shows.</p>

<p>Thanks for their support on Bloomberg Radio.</p>

<p>Emily Wilkins briefs with Bloomberg government in Washington.</p>

<p>Emily there are three levels of classified material.</p>

<p>It’s sort of a modern world definition of confidential secret and top secret.</p>

<p>But within that there are some hugely delicate topics particularly under top secret including from 1954 coming out of Korea.</p>

<p>What we see with restricted data and formerly restricted data what is the what if if some of these classified materials were restricted data.</p>

<p>I mean the big concern here is really national security.</p>

<p>The fact that according to The Washington Post reporting that some of these documents that the FBI was looking for related to nuclear data nuclear weapon information.</p>

<p>Now of course we don’t know a lot of details yet.</p>

<p>We don’t know if this had to do with U.S.</p>

<p>nuclear weapons with other countries nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>If that data was even found by the FBI when they did their search of Mar a Lago.</p>

<p>So I think there’s a lot left to be determined but we are hoping to find out more potentially as soon as today.</p>

<p>Now that former President Trump has said that he is going to engage his lawyers to go ahead and to unseal that warrant that’s pretty visible and laid out.</p>

<p>I guess we’re going to see something today maybe end of the weekend.</p>

<p>But what you’re interested in Emily is the affidavit which is the documents and persuasion the parties used with a judge to invade to search the president’s residence.</p>

<p>I mean yes.</p>

<p>I think the main question that we’re all trying to answer right now is why did the FBI need to search Mar a Lago.</p>

<p>How much was at risk for this particular search.</p>

<p>How much was on the line as far as U.S.</p>

<p>security and national security goes.</p>

<p>I mean those are all sort of the big questions.</p>

<p>I mean smarter legal minds than mine.</p>

<p>Mine isn’t even a legal mind.</p>

<p>We’ll be passing through the war when it is revealed.</p>

<p>We’ll be passing through things.</p>

<p>I will let them do the analysis.</p>

<p>At this point.</p>

<p>I think one interesting thing to say in Washington is that we saw a lot of Republicans come out with very strong statements after the FBI ISE search on Mar a Lago.</p>

<p>We really have not heard a lot of Republicans weighing in since Attorney General Merrick Garland presser the other day.</p>

<p>I think a lot of them are now waiting to see what exactly happens with this warrant and what happens when things are unsealed.</p>

<p>We now turn on a Friday to our legal mind.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowicz it was going to ask us about the legal side more about the political side.</p>

<p>And we saw shift gears and also plead ignorance.</p>

<p>But I do wonder whether the Republicans are using this as a talking point and calling it a raid and having it be a sort of thumping aspect whether it’s working in the polls.</p>

<p>I mean at this point it is a little too soon to tell.</p>

<p>Usually you know polling takes a couple days to get done and make sure that it’s all correct and well analyzed.</p>

<p>But at this point we are seeing a bit of a boost for Democrats.</p>

<p>If you look at the generic ballot if you look at polls sort of asking folks whether they’d rather have Republicans or Democrats in control.</p>

<p>This was a really great week for the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The fact that the House is on track to pass that health climate care climate climate change and tax bill today.</p>

<p>But the fact that you saw President Biden have those two bill signings one for the chips and semiconductors one for a toxic firm pets and extending that care to veterans who have been impacted by it.</p>

<p>Democrats are really going to be able to claim a lot of wins.</p>

<p>And they’re in the position that when they can go home to their constituents in their districts they can talk the lie about what they’ve been doing.</p>

<p>Plus the CPI data was really good for Biden this week.</p>

<p>Obviously it’s lots of questions about what those numbers are going to look like in coming months.</p>

<p>We still have eight point five percent but at least Democrats are have the potential scenario that it’s peaked.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>So the Democrats notching some wins ahead of the midterms.</p>

<p>But of course looking farther out there is a long way to go until 2024 Emily.</p>

<p>Yet we have fresh Bloomberg reporting from overnight about President Biden’s intention to run again if the matchup is Biden and Trump.</p>

<p>Is there confidence in Washington specifically among the Democratic Party that Biden would be the winner in that scenario.</p>

<p>There actually is.</p>

<p>I mean when you talk to Democrats a lot of them will point out very quickly that even though Biden doesn’t have a really great approval rating right now when he’s paired up against Trump he winds up on top and narrow margins.</p>

<p>But but still still out there.</p>

<p>And that’s why Biden ran in the first place.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>That’s what he’s talking about running again.</p>

<p>The more likely it becomes that Trump is going to have another run in 2024.</p>

<p>The more Biden things that he needs to be that candidate to run and then cut to the chase.</p>

<p>You’re going to have a mint julep this weekend with the senator from Kentucky Mr.</p>

<p>McConnell.</p>

<p>Is he giving up his House majority.</p>

<p>I mean is the Republicans screwed this up so bad they could actually come down to a few seats of majority or even lose it.</p>

<p>Is Greg Jihye Lee value you alluded to this morning.</p>

<p>You know it’s a really great question Tom.</p>

<p>And the community he touched on the point that it’s not it’s both the House and the Senate.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>It’s like Mitch McConnell.</p>

<p>He’s got to be a little bit worried right now.</p>

<p>You’ve seen a number of Senate Republican candidates falter a little bit in their campaigns haves you know a number of negative stories written about them.</p>

<p>A lot of questions about the ability for Republicans to win in states like Georgia in states like Pennsylvania at this point.</p>

<p>And then again as you mentioned Greg Valliere had a great piece this morning about the house that it was initially looking like Republicans would have this wave election like they would have a large majority next year.</p>

<p>Now there are questions about whether or not that’ll be the case.</p>

<p>Now Greg as well as a number of other really smart analysts do think that Republicans are still going to win the House in this November.</p>

<p>There’s that historical precedent there now that’s in their favor.</p>

<p>You know inflation is still high.</p>

<p>So dark suspecting at this point for Republicans to win.</p>

<p>But if Republicans only have really narrow margins that might limit what they’re able to get done especially if Democrats are able to hold the Senate.</p>

<p>Emily will could sink so much.</p>

<p>Greatly appreciate it this morning.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you a legal big Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>I mean it’s incredible how I’m reading background on this trying to keep up with you or Garrett Graff or others really on the high ground on this.</p>

<p>Well and the subpoena that we that was presented to president former President Trump was not revealed and will not be revealed.</p>

<p>And that actually is more details what he actually had to present to the.</p>

<p>Judge to make the argument for why they could do that.</p>

<p>The affidavit the affidavit.</p>

<p>Excuse me.</p>

<p>Yes incredible legal mind.</p>

<p>Legal veto makes it all.</p>

<p>Yeah exactly.</p>

<p>If you try to fill me into the rolls Caylee’s gone period.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Had to Google it yesterday time.</p>

<p>I think you should Google.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Bloomberg Surveillance on a Friday.</p>

<p>We’re getting you into the weekend the refrain here on equities bonds currencies commodities and of course the various and sundry news flows hydrocarbons front center today with Brent crude print of hundred on the way back up over the last number of days you’re watching natural gas in Europe all of the massive challenges there.</p>

<p>The chart of the week without question having a blast on electricity in France.</p>

<p>Truly a moonshot and a moonshot of worry there I should say.</p>

<p>Katie Lyons in for Jonathan Ferro.</p>

<p>I just I just want to say gentlemen had this out on Twitter.</p>

<p>And I mean Lisa and I were talking about it over breakfast at the at the St.</p>

<p>Regis yesterday.</p>

<p>And and Lisa the truth is the pharaoh is gone full European.</p>

<p>I mean you know this was not one one day halls that I would take.</p>

<p>This was like a substantial gap.</p>

<p>Basically someone on Twitter saying that’s so European.</p>

<p>What do we again.</p>

<p>Do we expect him Monday.</p>

<p>I mean perchance.</p>

<p>I believe so.</p>

<p>We believe so.</p>

<p>How things go.</p>

<p>Kailey Leinz or the short straw joins us today.</p>

<p>And that’s a good thing as well right now.</p>

<p>Q Julie Anticipated for November is a book but when Stephen Roach writes a book on China it has a focus and intent on their economics and politics like no other.</p>

<p>The book is Accidental Conflict America China and The Clash of False Narratives.</p>

<p>This is hugely anticipated by the Chinese watching community.</p>

<p>The gentleman from Yale and the size China’s center at Yale Law School joins us this morning.</p>

<p>Dr.</p>

<p>Rose thank you so much for joining.</p>

<p>You’ve written three or four books on China.</p>

<p>Why is this one different.</p>

<p>What is the tension at this moment.</p>

<p>Is Mr Xi goes to the party Congress.</p>

<p>Well time in the past five years we’ve gone from trade war to tech war to now a Cold War conflict is escalating.</p>

<p>There is no real framework to manage this conflict effectively let alone conceive of even the slightest semblance of resolution and enough period of escalating conflict.</p>

<p>The smallest spark can lead to a major clash and we certainly have seen one in the last week over Taiwan.</p>

<p>And I’m very worried about the possibility of a military accident in the Taiwan Straits occurring in the context of this escalating economic and technology conflict that could really lead to a serious outbreak between the United States and China.</p>

<p>The thesis of the book is the conflict would not have happened were it not for the false narratives that both nations harbor with respect to other.</p>

<p>And I develop these narratives in detail in the new book.</p>

<p>Well what is important here is what matter of diplomacy is needed.</p>

<p>What is the roach approach to a new diplomacy that can perhaps calm down these pressure points.</p>

<p>Well my idea and I develop it in detail on the final part of the book is that the current structure of engagement whether it’s the leader to leader phone call between Biden and Xi Jinping or earlier strategic and economic dialogues is grand.</p>

<p>Science has failed miserably.</p>

<p>And so I am proposing a permanent institution that I call for lack of a better term a U.S.</p>

<p>China secretariat that meets full time 24/7 staffed by an equal number of professionals on both sides of the relationship whose full time job is to deal with all aspects of the relationship from economics and trade to cyber and human rights.</p>

<p>And we need a new approach.</p>

<p>And this is one idea may not be perfect but it certainly beats the current failed approach.</p>

<p>Steve know there might be a lot of uncertainty on the policy side but businesses have to make moves.</p>

<p>They have to either expand and double down on their expansion plans in China or they have to withdraw which we’ve seen a number of companies do on the margins.</p>

<p>And we hear more and more about reassuring or on shoring of U.S.</p>

<p>companies away from China.</p>

<p>How materially will that shift the dynamic of trade at a time when a lot of people say this will be inflationary.</p>

<p>Well I think I think it will be inflationary.</p>

<p>I think that the trend toward reassure reassuring is an unmistakable outgrowth of geostrategic tensions between the United States and China.</p>

<p>They can better be addressed through a structure such as the one I just outlined.</p>

<p>Lisa.</p>

<p>But you know make no mistake this is very destabilizing not just for the U.S.</p>

<p>and inflation but also for China.</p>

<p>China benefited the most of any nation in the world from the upswing of globalization and it has the most to lose.</p>

<p>I think as we now move from globalization to deal globalization there’s a larger issue though for the economy.</p>

<p>And this is something that we were just hearing about from Ron Temple how he thinks that perhaps he’ll get back down to a 3 percent inflation rate but not much below that because we are in a new paradigm.</p>

<p>And I wonder how much is China the main part of that.</p>

<p>If you have reassuring which incurs more expense and you have slower growth in China because of exactly what you said because this is going to affect the world’s second biggest economy significantly.</p>

<p>How much does this portend a slower growth higher inflation environment for a longer term.</p>

<p>Well you know we debate how much China has held down U.S.</p>

<p>inflation over the past 20 years but it’s been significant as has the rapid expansion of global value chains or global supply chains.</p>

<p>And as supply chains are disrupted by China and other developments around the world.</p>

<p>As we move from offshore to onshore.</p>

<p>Good luck in getting inflation down to 3.</p>

<p>It’s going to be a very difficult goal to achieve.</p>

<p>Steve I’ve been dying to ask you this ship built Morgan Stanley economics.</p>

<p>You were the first American economists I know that tried to make a three legged Fed policy of unemployment inflation.</p>

<p>And you said watch the balance sheet the expansion of the balance sheet.</p>

<p>All that came true is you wrote about years ago.</p>

<p>What’s the Fed theory now if you were to if you were to parachute into Jackson Hole here at the end of Marcus.</p>

<p>What is the theory you’re going to find about central banking.</p>

<p>Well you know hard for me to know how they’re going to phrase it Tom but I think the Fed theory has got to go back to basics.</p>

<p>You know forget this QE balance sheet asset dependent economy it’s blown up repeatedly since Greenspan and Bernanke tried it in the 90s and the early 2000s.</p>

<p>The Fed’s got to go back to inflation targeting not average inflation targeting but plain old inflation targeting.</p>

<p>And we need a you know a dose of the very simplistic but tough and disciplined approach by Paul Volcker.</p>

<p>Jay Powell is it says he’s very much committed to doing this.</p>

<p>The Fed’s taking some big steps but.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Child’s play compared to what they have to do.</p>

<p>The real federal funds rate is still sharply negative.</p>

<p>You’re not going to control inflation with a sharply negative.</p>

<p>That’s that’s on the Elam side.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>Help me here with the real economy and the unemployment rate.</p>

<p>If we go out Lawrence Summers this morning and pop it up as Anna Wang at Bloomberg says to a 4 percent or 5 percent regime what does that do to America’s unemployment rate.</p>

<p>It’s going to go up Tom.</p>

<p>I mean you know we’ll give you a man to sit here.</p>

<p>No one’s watching.</p>

<p>Give me give me a man somewhere in the 4 to 5 percent zone which is you know a small price to pay.</p>

<p>No not for those who are affected by it of course but a small price to pay to get inflation back under a more stable path consistent with sustainable growth in the US.</p>

<p>The path we’re on right now doesn’t cut it.</p>

<p>OK so Stephen obviously there is a tradeoff potentially between keeping inflation in check and supporting growth and to tie it back to China.</p>

<p>The PBS see earlier this week was saying we aren’t going to go with massive stimulus to support the economy despite the turmoil in the property sector with the Covid zero policy causing issues because we are worried about the specter of inflation.</p>

<p>Do you expect that eventually if China isn’t going to take steps to breach a five and a half percent growth target that the Federal Reserve is going to back to.</p>

<p>Well I think you know that.</p>

<p>Are you asking about the Fed’s concerns over U.S.</p>

<p>economic growth.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I think the you know the mandate is going from dual to single inflation is the focus and they can’t afford to flinch on bringing inflation back because of political pressures that will be evident as the unemployment rate starts to rise.</p>

<p>And the Fed has just got to be fierce and focused on its independence and on his desire to bring inflation down as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Stephen Roach wonderful to catch up with you today of course at Yale Law School and formerly with the Wall Street firm named Morgan Stanley as well.</p>

<p>Lisa I really can’t say how alone Steve Roach was 20 years ago in saying this is a Fed policy that is just not simplistic.</p>

<p>NBER and congressional mandated policy that there was a sophisticated mix to the weights they would have to confront.</p>

<p>You asked earlier this morning what those notes were going to be like over the weekend.</p>

<p>What concessions there would be for some of the big bears.</p>

<p>What do you see and how much is it going to be this this sort of structural inflation that people are not counting for if the Fed wants to get back down to their 2 percent limit.</p>

<p>If they don’t take it.</p>

<p>Adam Posen 3 percent view of things.</p>

<p>Well then are we a lot further from that place than people think.</p>

<p>Is it a lot less attainable with the kind of growth that we have enjoyed in the recent past because of this reassuring on shoring the separation of the two powers.</p>

<p>We’ll just have to see.</p>

<p>Jeff the graph here over run macro.</p>

<p>Neil Dutta notes what many others have noted today.</p>

<p>We’ve had a 50 percent move what’s called a retracement up off the bottom of this grim bear market.</p>

<p>And it’s now what.</p>

<p>For the market it’s any number of themes there in guesses of where we’ll go.</p>

<p>Futures up 17.</p>

<p>Dow futures up one way.</p>

<p>McKinley I guess we’re all doing that.</p>

<p>We’re all in anticipation of what equity strategists are going to write this weekend.</p>

<p>Yeah I can’t wait to see if we see any actual revisions to year end targets especially for the bears out there that we’re warning a margin pressures.</p>

<p>Talking about producer price inflation putting pressure on companies and yet that came in cool too.</p>

<p>Does that start to change the fundamental calculus as well and make this not just a meltdown maybe August and that we’re looking for a not year end.</p>

<p>I mean things are so original right now.</p>

<p>Covid version we’ve gone from negative 49 basis points to negative 30 for less inverted.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word answers you could get to.</p>

<p>There’s a report that among the items FBI agents searched for at Donald Trump’s Florida home were classified documents related to nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>According to The Washington Post people familiar with the investigation didn’t say if those documents were found.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed.</p>

<p>President Biden wants four more years.</p>

<p>Bloomberg Surveillance.</p>

<p>The president is set to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections.</p>

<p>Those close to Bloomberg says he’s encouraged by recent legislative economic and foreign policy successes.</p>

<p>But polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s ambassador to Washington is cautioning the U.S.</p>

<p>and its allies against fatigue over a war that’s costing billions in security assistance.</p>

<p>Oksana Michael Barr told Bloomberg that it would be far costlier in the end to let Russia’s president Vladimir Putin go unchallenged.</p>

<p>She says that if Putin isn’t stopped in Ukraine he’ll attack other countries in Europe.</p>

<p>Today the Rhine River is likely to shrink to a level that could disrupt the transport of fuel throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The effects could ripple through the continent for months.</p>

<p>The water level at a key waypoint west of Frankfort is set to go below about 16 inches and continue dwindling.</p>

<p>That makes it uneconomical for barges carrying coal and oil to transit the river.</p>

<p>And in the UK the economy shrank in the second quarter for the first time since the pandemic.</p>

<p>The gross domestic product fell one tenth of one percent.</p>

<p>Though retail sales and the first drop in household consumption in more than a year were factors.</p>

<p>So it was declining Covid testing and vaccinations.</p>

<p>Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries which could get to.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>They’re significant in that they’re saying we’re seeing some improvement but they’re not victory.</p>

<p>We haven’t read inflation report and unemployment report coming out before the next meeting really behooves us to stay data independent and not call it Mary Daly of the San Francisco Fed widely anticipated there.</p>

<p>And of course the heated battle into the weekend of different components as we just heard from Steve Roach of Yale Law School.</p>

<p>Good to hear from him as well.</p>

<p>Right now on the markets there’s a lift to the markets.</p>

<p>Got a Friday feel to it.</p>

<p>And Lisa even mentioned this in anticipation of retail sales next week.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And actually those are no good days.</p>

<p>But today’s Friday retail sales are next week.</p>

<p>I just want to point this out that Citi put out a report saying that their credit card transaction chat transaction data excuse me it is Friday clearly shows a decline in spending in certain retail areas and it’s pretty much across the board.</p>

<p>This is in nominal terms.</p>

<p>So in real terms even more.</p>

<p>How does that factor into this disinflationary environment is just feet at Tom at a time when a lot of people are counting on soft landing now that reported in next week as well.</p>

<p>Right now we’re going to digress here.</p>

<p>I thought what Lisa was talking was Dr.</p>

<p>Shiller about on the break was really really important.</p>

<p>Wendy Shiller’s with Brown University director of the Taubman Center for American Politics and a writer of core textbooks on our civics as well.</p>

<p>We’ve alluded to this before Wendy but I want to talk about two candidates who I believe will be 78 and 82.</p>

<p>In 2024.</p>

<p>And that means if my math is right there’ll be 82 and 86 on the way out the door in two thousand twenty eight.</p>

<p>How did we get the fossils running for president.</p>

<p>Well I think general trends in aging are are good and people are aging better across the country.</p>

<p>So that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>I think in time that came out of a very long where people thought was a very long recession and the world has become less stable.</p>

<p>Obviously the Cold War ended and we all celebrated freedom around the world but freedom brought with it a lot of unpredictability.</p>

<p>And then of course we had the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>And when you have that much tumbled and uncertainty and certainly even the 9/11 attacks people want comfort.</p>

<p>They want people who’ve been around a long time could tell them to shoot.</p>

<p>This too shall pass.</p>

<p>People look to the familiar.</p>

<p>They look to people with quote unquote experience.</p>

<p>Donald Trump had business experience that he touted and Joe Biden had more than 30 years in government.</p>

<p>Wendy.</p>

<p>I’m struggling with that idea because we’ve seen poll after poll saying that they would like to see new blood put leading the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>They would like to see a younger slew of Congress members across the board as we enter into a very new phase.</p>

<p>Is it a good thing or a bad thing for the Democrats that President Biden announced his intention to run again.</p>

<p>I think it’s a good thing you can’t have a president not even ending his second year full year in office.</p>

<p>He says well I’m not in anymore.</p>

<p>I mean even if there’s the slightest chance Biden can still be president and a couple of years from now that makes a difference in terms of influence.</p>

<p>That makes a difference in terms of public opinion.</p>

<p>You just can’t be written off.</p>

<p>We saw this with Clinton after the Republicans won the midterms in 94.</p>

<p>You know he’s irrelevant.</p>

<p>He doesn’t.</p>

<p>He won two years later relatively easily.</p>

<p>You have to maintain the exercise of power and the illusion that you want to keep that power.</p>

<p>So I think that’s a strategically important thing for Biden to do and there isn’t a reason for him not to do it.</p>

<p>So you think that this is more about the visual is more about the illusion and less about a true intention to run.</p>

<p>Well I think he can stay.</p>

<p>He can stay in this race until somebody in the primary starts to beat him.</p>

<p>And you know the myth that primaries are bad for parties at the presidential level Azman has been debunked.</p>

<p>Now we know that it generates more turnout and generates people registering to vote knowing the polling places they get out the door.</p>

<p>There’s you know we know that it increases turnout amongst the party members.</p>

<p>So that means that it’s a good thing to have some fighting some challenging some anticipation.</p>

<p>So if he’s in it and other people want to challenge him that just means more Democrats get in the game to to vote.</p>

<p>And we know that Republicans will be very very energized in 24 to about whom they will be loyal.</p>

<p>We don’t know who they’re going to pick.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>You know I think they’ll be more than one person in that race.</p>

<p>Yeah it’s a good point Wendy.</p>

<p>Obviously there’s multiple variables at play.</p>

<p>Let’s just assume for the moment that the 2024 candidate on the Republican side hypothetically would be President Trump.</p>

<p>Is there anyone on the Democratic side of likely potential candidate who would be able to beat him other than President Biden.</p>

<p>Well if the election were held today of unclear to me that anybody could except for Biden.</p>

<p>And again people like what they’re used to.</p>

<p>There’s been a lot of victories lately for the Democrats.</p>

<p>You know if economic conditions you know ease up I think that you know the president former President Trump is facing a lot of different inquiries.</p>

<p>Some of them are more scary than others I think to voters.</p>

<p>And again that core of independent suburban voters is key.</p>

<p>They rejected Trump in 2020.</p>

<p>And I think there isn’t any reason to think they’re going to welcome them back with open arms and 24.</p>

<p>So I think that’s what the Democrats are counting on.</p>

<p>But you know Pritzker an Illinois big state that Gavin Newsom in California big state.</p>

<p>Kathy Hochul if she wins again big in New York becomes a player.</p>

<p>And then of course there are a couple people in his cabinet that might want to run which makes for awkward cabinet meetings theoretically later on.</p>

<p>But we we are seeing energy.</p>

<p>Energy on the Republican side.</p>

<p>And now we’re starting to see a little bit more energy on the Democratic side.</p>

<p>You have to maintain the energy so you have to give them choice.</p>

<p>But you are the most powerful person in the world.</p>

<p>And why you would walk away from that two years early.</p>

<p>You know that’s just that’s political malpractice.</p>

<p>And Wendy finally if we could just look to the more immediate future and the midterms in November there was a sense prior to this week that Democratic momentum was building.</p>

<p>You have the inflation reduction at gas prices are coming down and it’s looking a little bit more optimistic for the Biden administration.</p>

<p>And yet as you allude to you now have this galvanizing force when it comes to President Trump’s base because of the FBI search of Mar a Lago.</p>

<p>Do those two forces cancel each other out.</p>

<p>And we’re now left with kind of the same outlook on the midterms as we had before.</p>

<p>That’s an outstanding question.</p>

<p>I think for Democrats though and again this independent group if Trump looks like this base of Trump’s is going to get out the door and there and they are behaving in ways that are frightening to some people like trying to bust into an FBI office with you know being armor being armed I think that scares suburban voters.</p>

<p>It scares independent voters.</p>

<p>And it looks like this will give Trump momentum.</p>

<p>I think the same forces that got the door 20 18 on the Democratic side will get out the door again.</p>

<p>You load up abortion on that in key states.</p>

<p>It’s going to be a referendum statewide.</p>

<p>I think that is going to help the Democrats.</p>

<p>I don’t know if it saves them for the House but it could very well save them for the Senate.</p>

<p>What it shows.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for joining us with an August update.</p>

<p>She is at Brown University here in the politics of the moment.</p>

<p>Lisa as you said there are the best in the year.</p>

<p>And you wonder just getting to August end.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Two more.</p>

<p>Right now it’s just that large.</p>

<p>Her comments though were fascinating that when you get a contested primary which is unusual when you have a sitting president still running you get greater turnout you generate more interest.</p>

<p>There is a greater debate that brings eyeballs into the fold.</p>

<p>And that that actually could be helpful not only for the midterm elections but also for what we’re going to see in 2024.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting point lost under the headlines of really is he really going to run again.</p>

<p>He’s going to be 81 blah blah blah.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting point.</p>

<p>I would go back to the markets with this stunning move we’ve had since I think it’s June 16th.</p>

<p>There’s sort of two discussions going on into.</p>

<p>Sort of a reaffirmation by the financial system that things can recover versus all the myriad Kelly the myriad of uncertainties that are out there.</p>

<p>Removed from what we look at every day on Bloomberg Surveillance uncertainty on many policy fronts.</p>

<p>Tom when it comes to just policymaking in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>who ultimately is going to have the role of Congress and the legislative agenda and then policymaking on the side of the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>How much really changed for them.</p>

<p>This week they say not much.</p>

<p>The market says otherwise.</p>

<p>Two avenues to good discourse on this balance of powers.</p>

<p>Look for that balance of power 12 noon David Westin.</p>

<p>And I’d really also mentioned Joe Mathews hard hitting sound on 5 p.m.</p>

<p>on Bloomberg Radio.</p>

<p>We say good morning.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long it will take to come down but clearly the momentum is down on inflation.</p>

<p>Yes they are coming down but I think they’re very far away from the Fed’s objective.</p>

<p>We look at other measures of inflation.</p>

<p>There’s still a lot of work for the Fed to do with the economy slowing and inflation is coming off.</p>

<p>They want to be sure they’re are on the right track.</p>

<p>I think the Fed looks at this had been as the beginning of of their battle and having been more credible but having more work to do.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Good morning everyone.</p>

<p>Jonathan Ferro.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Tom Keene on radio.</p>

<p>On television Lisa.</p>

<p>Finally a point.</p>

<p>This reallocation Friday everybody out there is gonna rewrite for the weekend CPI while the jobs report was wow retail sales next week.</p>

<p>That’s going to be while everybody has to adjust.</p>

<p>So time are going to pull the trigger out of a triple leverage all cash into reallocating into bitcoin or say all big tech.</p>

<p>I’m going to take the worst fractional shares of Apple maybe.</p>

<p>My point is when do you get in.</p>

<p>When do you see the bottom.</p>

<p>How far out.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Look do you look out a month.</p>

<p>Do you say that this rally could continue because of technical reasons over the next three weeks.</p>

<p>Or do you start preparing for that yield curve inversion signal.</p>

<p>Yes it’s gotten less inverted but still signaling a slowdown that some people say hasn’t been priced in.</p>

<p>We did this with Ron Temple in the last hour Lazard Asset Management David Liebowitz.</p>

<p>We were zero moments with the JP Morgan really looking forward to this raging debate about what to do here and what to do here.</p>

<p>Lisa is always the fixed income market leads the way is the fixed income market leading equities know right now if the fixed income were leading it would send the same signal at least if you look at credit that equities are signaling which is if we get any kind of downturn it’s going to be shallow and the resilient companies are going to remain resilient and are going to be able to pay their bills.</p>

<p>And that is why you’re getting the biggest inflows into investment grade credit going back to September 21.</p>

<p>I do wonder though why are we still seeing yield curves inverted.</p>

<p>Why are we seeing such low longer term yields.</p>

<p>If people believe that we do have you know some sort of soft landing ahead that we can then revive from.</p>

<p>And so these are some of the conundrums baked into the bond market that’s not telling a consistent story.</p>

<p>Let me let me let me steal from John Lumiere over at MSNBC way too early.</p>

<p>Caley Lines is the queen of way too early in for John Farrow today.</p>

<p>Kelly you’re doing a more European show than we are.</p>

<p>Is there a believes that the hydrocarbon disaster of Europe can move over to the United States.</p>

<p>I think there is a sense Tom that the United States is going to be relatively more interested or insulated.</p>

<p>But obviously Europe is dealing with a substantial energy crisis one that is poised to potentially get Reuters beginning today when part of the Rhine River becomes impassible for cargoes of things like going through this.</p>

<p>I mean I don’t need a tour guide here.</p>

<p>You know I’m I’m scheduled to take the tour in 2025 to go Castle watching.</p>

<p>But the bottom line clearly is we can’t get coal.</p>

<p>So nat gas goes up.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>And that is the problem that Europe is facing.</p>

<p>It is an energy driven inflationary shock in Europe one that central banks the ECB are poised to do very little about on the supply side.</p>

<p>And yet they are still trying to hike rates until a European economy that is weakening due to the very same energy crisis and the high cost of living.</p>

<p>Lisa from the Upper East Side e-mails and says get to the day to check.</p>

<p>I got to do the brief futures up 13.</p>

<p>Dow futures up 99.</p>

<p>The VIX under under 20 was a big deal for me.</p>

<p>Still twenty point one nine shows a resiliency of equities this week.</p>

<p>Fixed income it’s gyrating.</p>

<p>We have less curve and version now but nevertheless a negative 34 basis points is important.</p>

<p>Fair or not here I don’t know who’s doing the real yield.</p>

<p>I’m not doing the real yield.</p>

<p>The real yield points 3 8 percent here on a Friday.</p>

<p>Right now we need to be briefed.</p>

<p>It’s auction free.</p>

<p>Here’s Lisa Abramowicz and I will be doing real yield that we actually have real yield.</p>

<p>Just what to say across the board.</p>

<p>Even two year yields are real in inflation adjusted terms for the first time going back to before the pandemic which is a fascinating turn of events especially given the rally that we’ve been seeing today.</p>

<p>And this is what we’re looking for.</p>

<p>And if we had to perhaps frame the day differently it would have been University of Michigan sentiment Friday.</p>

<p>How much do we get an ongoing increase in terms of how people are feeling especially as you get a reprieve from gas prices.</p>

<p>This particular survey more closely tracks gas prices when they go up.</p>

<p>People feel worse when they go down.</p>

<p>People feel better.</p>

<p>How much do we start to see that really trickle into longer term inflation expectations.</p>

<p>And how much does the Fed respond to that at 12:00 p.m..</p>

<p>This is the real world.</p>

<p>And what we saw in CPI ISE Wednesday was that food rose at the fastest pace going back for prices going back to 1979 in the United States.</p>

<p>How much can supply come back online.</p>

<p>How elastic Tom Keene is your words.</p>

<p>Is this market as we deal with drought across the country in the United States.</p>

<p>The USDA world agricultural supply.</p>

<p>Demand report comes out.</p>

<p>We get a sense of corn soybeans as well as what’s going to be forward for cotton and a whole host of other commodities.</p>

<p>And on Sunday Saudi Aramco reporting earnings.</p>

<p>We’re expecting to see a similar kind of boom in terms of earnings.</p>

<p>Do they give a sense of this to stories that we’re getting from the IEA and OPEC Tom.</p>

<p>Because right now we’re hearing from the IEA that the demand for oil is going to increase as people pivot from natural gas to oil to plug the supplies.</p>

<p>And then we hear from OPEC that there’s going to be a surplus.</p>

<p>So which is it.</p>

<p>And can Saudi Aramco give some sort of its name.</p>

<p>Very good.</p>

<p>Let’s get started here with two short a visit with David Liebowitz who’s global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.</p>

<p>And buried in your note on the struggles of this summer and getting to the fall in just trying to say OK.</p>

<p>I don’t want to run around my head.</p>

<p>Cut off is the idea that three years is the new short term.</p>

<p>How do you invest for three years as the new short term.</p>

<p>If the present is such a jumble.</p>

<p>So I think when it comes to three years let’s call that the medium term.</p>

<p>To me the key is to really focus on two things.</p>

<p>It’s the focus on valuation and it’s the focus on earnings power.</p>

<p>Stock markets have rerated so far this year.</p>

<p>July was a very good month.</p>

<p>And so prices aren’t necessarily looking as attractive as they did.</p>

<p>But when we look at the equity market today we still see fairly tremendous dispersion between the expensive names and the cheap names.</p>

<p>Now you know sometimes the expensive names have been over bid because people are too positive on their prospects for earnings.</p>

<p>Sometimes the cheap names are cheap for a reason.</p>

<p>And so it’s really blending that combination of value and earnings growth.</p>

<p>Almost a Gabi approach if you will.</p>

<p>That I think will be the best one to take over the course of the next couple of years.</p>

<p>David Leibovitz your colleague David Kelley over at J.P.</p>

<p>Morgan Asset Management yesterday said that stocks will revisit their all time highs and then surpass them in the next three years.</p>

<p>That actually is consensus.</p>

<p>If you look across the different Wall Street houses it’s the path to get there.</p>

<p>That really is the question.</p>

<p>What is the trajectory.</p>

<p>How low do we go before we go back up short.</p>

<p>So he is he he’s more than a colleague.</p>

<p>He’s actually my boss.</p>

<p>So I better.</p>

<p>No but I think it’s a reasonable point to make.</p>

<p>I think that over the next three years we will see new all time highs in the equity market.</p>

<p>Again you know to your point the question is much more so around how we get there.</p>

<p>And you know people are still talking about the Fed and the potential for a soft landing.</p>

<p>The reality is that the historical data does not suggest that the Fed is is terribly adept when it comes to landing the plane gently.</p>

<p>And so I do think that we’re going to be experiencing some turbulence here into the end of this year and the beginning of next year could easily go back down below four thousand thirty seven hundred.</p>

<p>That would connect the dots with the trend line that we were on prior to the pandemic.</p>

<p>But what I think the market wants to see here is it wants to see two things.</p>

<p>It wants to see the inflation genie going back into the bottle.</p>

<p>And then that’s somewhat obvious.</p>

<p>I also think that the market wants to see some deterioration in the labor market.</p>

<p>It’s it’s somewhat contrary.</p>

<p>But if we see the unemployment rate begin to rise after a very hot number in July that’s going to give the market confidence that what the Fed is doing is correct.</p>

<p>And if we do have a downturn it’ll be relatively short lived.</p>

<p>And so I think the market would be comfortable if it can’t get the soft landing with with a bumpy landing maybe a shallow recession.</p>

<p>But we need to see signals that labor is beginning to cool off.</p>

<p>That’s going to be instrumental to getting markets on a more positive trajectory.</p>

<p>David other than the conversation with your boss another conversation we had yesterday was with Jim Paulson of Lew’s Hold Group who essentially said he sees the case for additional Fed tightening rapidly dissipating and that ultimately it’s not the Fed that’s driving the boat right now.</p>

<p>It is the market which is consistently seeing pushing financial conditions into looser territory not paying attention to the commentary we’re getting out of Federal Reserve officials.</p>

<p>Who do you think’s ultimately going to end up on the right side of that.</p>

<p>So it is a bit concerning to see financial conditions loosened after back to back 75 basis point hikes.</p>

<p>I frankly think that the Fed is going to continue to move fairly aggressively here.</p>

<p>We’ll see what the futures pricing looks like when it gets closer to September.</p>

<p>But I do think that if the market is opening the door for the Fed to do another 75 basis points they’ll do it.</p>

<p>Because what the Fed is trying to do here is get policy into territory that is going to actively slow the economy.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’ll fight the futures market.</p>

<p>But again I think if that door opens up the Fed’s going to step right through it.</p>

<p>So by our lights the Fed is going to remain on on a relatively pre-set course into the end of the year.</p>

<p>What I think will get them moving in the opposite direction is a meaningful deterioration in the labor market.</p>

<p>But they are going to tolerate a higher unemployment rate than they have historically.</p>

<p>David we are drowning in history of the moment.</p>

<p>I mean the idea of a search of a former president’s residence just as one example you arguably went to the most prestigious history program in America Williams College the font of James MacGregor Burns.</p>

<p>How do we invest and adapt to the history in the making.</p>

<p>The James MacGregor Burns and others wrote about.</p>

<p>So I think what’s so.</p>

<p>Interesting about the current environment and you know we meet with clients across the United States and they always want to know what’s the big risk you know and usually it’s something that we’re able to tell is a big risk a threat to democracy.</p>

<p>We know it’s really rare that that is one what one angle to take.</p>

<p>But what I was going to say is you know there there are risks that we can see and there are risks that we can see but we have more difficulty getting our arms around if we see some sort of imbalance in the economy housing running to hot investment spending running to higher vehicle sales running too hot.</p>

<p>We can quantify that and we can begin to build expectations about what a reversal in that would mean for the outlook for economic growth.</p>

<p>The problem is the real risks in the current environment.</p>

<p>They’re coming from the social side of things.</p>

<p>They’re coming from the political side of things.</p>

<p>And those are very difficult to quantify.</p>

<p>And so you’ve been telling clients that when you can see a clear risk you can hedge against it.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Higher rates and a more hawkish fed when you can’t necessarily see the risk coming or you can’t quantify the risk that exists.</p>

<p>That’s when we diversify.</p>

<p>That’s when diversification is your friend.</p>

<p>David thank you so much.</p>

<p>And thank you for visiting today.</p>

<p>David live at center headquarters here with JP Morgan Asset Management.</p>

<p>Lisa I think this is a huge huge deal and it’s phrased differently now than anytime over 30 40 even 50 years.</p>

<p>And that is how do you invest with a cacophony of history and news flow we’re all dealing with now.</p>

<p>And what David just said there was brilliant that when you cannot see the risks you need to diversify what you can see the risks you can more accurately hedge.</p>

<p>And that is the moment that we’re seeing is channeling Peter Bernstein I would say.</p>

<p>Well there we are.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>David Liebowitz again.</p>

<p>Futures up 12.</p>

<p>Dow futures up 85 again next week.</p>

<p>We look at retail sales coming up.</p>

<p>Jeffrey U V NY Mellon this is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with these from around the world with the first right answers you can get at Bloomberg’s learned that President Biden is preparing to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections.</p>

<p>That sets up a potential rematch with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Those close to President Biden describe him as upbeat about recent legislative economic and foreign policy victories.</p>

<p>Polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate.</p>

<p>FBI agents reportedly search Donald Trump’s Florida home for classified documents related to nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>That’s according to The Washington Post.</p>

<p>And he’s made this as people familiar with the probe didn’t say if the documents were recovered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed.</p>

<p>San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley says the cooler inflation reading for July is welcome and she believes it may be appropriate for the Fed to slow its interest rate increases to 50 basis points next month.</p>

<p>Still to Daley told Bloomberg TV the fight against inflation is far from over.</p>

<p>She says rate hikes need to be dependent on data.</p>

<p>Three of China’s biggest state owned companies tried to delist from U.S.</p>

<p>exchanges.</p>

<p>That’s fallout from a dispute over whether American regulators should be allowed to inspect audits of Chinese businesses that are listed in the U.S..</p>

<p>The three companies that will do list are China Life Pet China and Sinopec CEO Shi Sun has now lost more than four billion dollars on a series of side deals.</p>

<p>He set up a Softbank to boost his compensation.</p>

<p>The Japanese billionaire took the unusual step of establishing personal stakes in a series of Softbank Ventures in recent years.</p>

<p>That was a mixing of company and executive interests that drew the ire of investors.</p>

<p>Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries and which could get to.</p>

<p>This is Olympic.</p>

<p>Former President Trump is exactly a former president.</p>

<p>He’s a citizen.</p>

<p>He’s not a president who has the ability or the the the law abiding notion that he can hold on to classified documents a notion somehow he might still have that information.</p>

<p>That in itself would constitute a crime that might touch a senator from Maine a former U.S.</p>

<p>secretary of defense William Cohen there on the political moment.</p>

<p>Add that and we welcome all of you right now.</p>

<p>Lisa I want to get to some very quickly.</p>

<p>I think it’s so important in the equity cave here at Bloomberg Media the guy that makes us go is Peter Deal Terrorists.</p>

<p>And he has a chart out today.</p>

<p>Lisa alludes to what you said earlier in the swing here in recent days of cash losing negative four point three billion in stocks gaining eighteen point one billion stardust.</p>

<p>Extraordinary.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>And it stocks and its credit lines.</p>

<p>It’s taking cash out and putting it into everything else somehow.</p>

<p>This has been a shift.</p>

<p>If you want to look at the Wall Street notes over the weekend fine.</p>

<p>But right now there’s a vote with the money and it very much is for a shift in reality.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>People ask you this Peter.</p>

<p>Is it incense or murdered.</p>

<p>He uses and he’s sort of in there with both.</p>

<p>But in the cave the Merc can clear the air.</p>

<p>Peter thank you for that work this morning.</p>

<p>Emily Wilkins drives us forward.</p>

<p>A Bloomberg government right now we’ve been talking and talking and talking about these political events as Mr.</p>

<p>Trump a former president.</p>

<p>Let us move on from that to actually what may happen in Washington.</p>

<p>Is it the dog days of August in Washington.</p>

<p>Emily does the city roll up.</p>

<p>Well we’re hoping that maybe after today everyone can finally take a breath and get onto the August that we were all hoping to have at the start of this year.</p>

<p>You saw the Senate work all last weekend.</p>

<p>Pull those all night sessions trying to get through the what is left of President Joe Biden’s reckons proposed reconciliation package.</p>

<p>That’s the tax pieces the climate piece and the health care piece.</p>

<p>Senate got it done.</p>

<p>House’s turn is today.</p>

<p>They’re expected a final vote on that legislation around about 2 3 4 o’clock this afternoon.</p>

<p>It is expected to pass.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>Democrats did have their concerns with the bill.</p>

<p>The fact it didn’t have the state and local tax caps the fact it didn’t deal with immigration.</p>

<p>In fact it left a lot of other pieces on the cutting room floor.</p>

<p>But Tom just a few months ago they were looking at a reality where they didn’t get anything else passed and everyone kind of decided they’d rather take what they have now than to not take anything at all.</p>

<p>Emily we’ve focused on the potential for a legislative victory more than the substance itself at times.</p>

<p>And I do wonder how much you hear in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>under the hood of getting something done about the blowback from allies of the United States who are saying you’re crediting companies that really make cars make batteries make goods in the United States.</p>

<p>That affects us badly.</p>

<p>How are you going to help us.</p>

<p>I mean how does this affect the international relations of a nation trying to repair what’s been lost.</p>

<p>Well to a certain extent.</p>

<p>I mean that’s certainly a valid question and a valid angle to take a look at.</p>

<p>I think right now perhaps lawmakers are a little bit more focused particularly those who have re-election.</p>

<p>Coming up more of what’s happening in their own districts.</p>

<p>What can they sell to Americans.</p>

<p>What can they pitch to Americans.</p>

<p>And a lot of this is going to be things like extending some subsidies with the Affordable Care Act that were put in place during the pandemic.</p>

<p>There are concerns that you know your people if those aren’t extended folks are going to see their insurance premiums go up right before this election.</p>

<p>A similar things with climate change.</p>

<p>Obviously that’s a big priority for a lot of Democratic voters to be able to say that they got that done and things like that.</p>

<p>Minimum 15 percent corporate tax on certain corporations making are earning high amounts.</p>

<p>Democrats have seen that polling.</p>

<p>Polling shows that Americans are supportive of taxing companies and sort of making them pay their fair share.</p>

<p>So these are all policies that lawmakers can really go out and promote.</p>

<p>Of course there’s a lot of things that they were initially talking about child care tax credits a pre-K on a national level that just aren’t going to happen at this point.</p>

<p>And certainly there might be some concerns from Democrats that those things aren’t getting done at the same point.</p>

<p>The really the big attitude right now in Washington is something is better than nothing especially when the midterms are less than three months away now.</p>

<p>Emily as we get closer to that vote we’ve had a lot of conversation about a potential shift in the narrative the odds maybe skewing a little bit more in the Democratic Party’s favor than say just a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>But at the same time we know that American politics are extremely partisan and polarized.</p>

<p>How many minds realistically are left to change.</p>

<p>How many more swing voters are there.</p>

<p>You know it’s really funny you mentioned that Kelly.</p>

<p>I was in Michigan at the start of July of reporting on a House race there between two incumbents.</p>

<p>I did all this reporting and I talked to all these folks hours before the polls were going to close.</p>

<p>I got a text from my mom be like who should I vote for.</p>

<p>And it just reminded me that there are a lot of Americans.</p>

<p>They just they’re not thinking about Washington right now.</p>

<p>They’re not thinking about the CPI numbers.</p>

<p>They’re thinking about what they’re paying at the grocery store.</p>

<p>They’re thinking about how much they’re putting in their gas.</p>

<p>They’re focused on their own homes their own families their own communities.</p>

<p>And they’re not going to start thinking about this stuff until October.</p>

<p>So there’s still a lot of time for the narrative to change.</p>

<p>We’ve got more CPI reports coming out.</p>

<p>We obviously have more to the story of a search warrant in Mar a Lago.</p>

<p>A lot can change.</p>

<p>Believe that is absolutely textbook.</p>

<p>I’m imagining my mother who is to the right of John Birch up say food for Emily who’s going to vote in Wyoming for Miss Cheney here.</p>

<p>How is she.</p>

<p>Oh what level of down in flames is Liz Cheney going to go here on Tuesday.</p>

<p>So we’ve already seen Liz Cheney shift her messaging around this campaign.</p>

<p>It is no longer about winning this congressional seat.</p>

<p>It is more about what her legacy is going to be in Washington and team her up for the next chapter of her career whatever that is going to be.</p>

<p>We saw her make her final ad her final pitch to voters before Tuesday’s upcoming primary.</p>

<p>And it was basically all focused on Donald Trump and her saying that you know he’s a threat to this country.</p>

<p>He can’t be back as president and that she’ll do whatever she can to stop him.</p>

<p>It does not sound like your normal political ad and I think it really signals what we saw in the polling yesterday.</p>

<p>She’s 30 points behind.</p>

<p>She’s not gonna be able to hold the seat.</p>

<p>It’s just a question of what comes next.</p>

<p>Emily can we agree that Lynne Cheney.</p>

<p>Called up Liz Cheney said who should I vote for.</p>

<p>I think that there is a slightly different dynamic.</p>

<p>Billy thank you so much.</p>

<p>That was classic Emily Wilkins with Bloomberg Government in Washington.</p>

<p>I’m sorry Lisa.</p>

<p>That’s great.</p>

<p>I mean we’ve gone so far from where you know your father held you in his arms.</p>

<p>While you know you’ve got to push down the metal toggle switches and move the knob of the voting booth.</p>

<p>Miles we’re back to chads I guess is where we are.</p>

<p>It depends on where you go in some of the voting booths that I’ve been in in New York City.</p>

<p>They still have those men.</p>

<p>Let’s do this.</p>

<p>Oh yes they do.</p>

<p>They’re not electronic.</p>

<p>But do you know all of the people on a ballot.</p>

<p>All of the judges all of everyone on the local and on you know and beyond.</p>

<p>When you go to the voting booth.</p>

<p>No no I don’t.</p>

<p>And it’s a huge problem and really speaks to the television focus and indeed the radio focus as well at the national level where we may be less familiar with our local politics.</p>

<p>We’re familiar with the day to check here a lift to the market on a Friday.</p>

<p>Futures up 12 Dow futures up 90.</p>

<p>Again Jeff for you will attend.</p>

<p>Victoria Fernandez as well.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Good morning everyone.</p>

<p>Bloomberg Surveillance on a Friday.</p>

<p>Jonathan Ferro on assignment.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowicz and Tom Keene Kailey Leinz holding court as well as Friday to go into the Friday and weekend reading.</p>

<p>It will be more than interesting particularly on what the equity markets will do.</p>

<p>Let me do a day to check right now.</p>

<p>Futures up 14 Dow futures up 1 0 5.</p>

<p>The VIX 19 level earlier twenty point one.</p>

<p>It’s still extraordinary given the move from June to higher yield three point to 1 percent.</p>

<p>We do have curve inversion but less curve inversion than pre CPI negative 34 basis points as well moving in from a greatly inverted negative forty nine basis points.</p>

<p>We had one hundred dollar print on Brent crude.</p>

<p>Moments ago an hour ago I should say ninety eight point four five gyrations in oil and natural gas this morning and the individual equity stocks.</p>

<p>Lisa pulled an all nighter to give.</p>

<p>Oh yeah.</p>

<p>All nighter analyzing revision and the electric vehicles.</p>

<p>They don’t get out of your head start with really.</p>

<p>Well really it is actually fascinating.</p>

<p>Their shares are lower right now by two tenths of a percent.</p>

<p>They actually beat expectations but they forecast a bigger than expected loss.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem.</p>

<p>They haven’t gotten production up to speed to meet all of the demand.</p>

<p>So they have people making orders two years in advance.</p>

<p>And then in the meantime the costs are going up.</p>

<p>Of the raw materials that they use for all of these goods.</p>

<p>So how do they deal with that without going back to a lot of these individuals and say hey give us our money which is not what they want to be doing on this company.</p>

<p>That is Jessica Alba is company that has home products.</p>

<p>It reported a worse than expected earnings but also a bigger than expected loss for the year.</p>

<p>Those shares down nearly three tenths of a percent and toast is surging.</p>

<p>I had not heard of toast before today.</p>

<p>Towns struggling today.</p>

<p>I mean these are all down.</p>

<p>OK so Joe’s restaurant.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>Yes thank you.</p>

<p>It’s restaurant software.</p>

<p>And it’s up more than 13 percent.</p>

<p>I find this interesting because it comes after Doordarshan.</p>

<p>Others outperform.</p>

<p>How much are the delivery services people order again.</p>

<p>Really doing well.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>In other news today the Chinese DAX really sounds like this is boring.</p>

<p>Go back to auctions.</p>

<p>Petro China and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp.</p>

<p>both plummeting after saying that they were going to delist from the New York Stock Exchange come mid September.</p>

<p>And this comes after a lot of pressure from China plummeting.</p>

<p>They were they had fallen more significantly.</p>

<p>Now they’re down just one point two percent two point four percent respectively.</p>

<p>And I’m pointing to Bed Bath and Beyond not because they reported earnings but every day when I come in I look at Bed Bath and Beyond and AMC to see whether the Reddit jury is still still going strong whether you still have the Robin Hood traders the individual traders and it is still on a tear.</p>

<p>So up 4 percent because why not.</p>

<p>Kelly was at the worst stock market report we’ve ever had.</p>

<p>I mean that was like a Friday struggle.</p>

<p>No I’m I’m all for it.</p>

<p>I think she nailed it.</p>

<p>Dude like Facebook do nothing yesterday or worse.</p>

<p>It’s called meta now.</p>

<p>Tom BODETT Tesla Free.</p>

<p>I mean I just.</p>

<p>I know but I think to her point on Bed Bath and Beyond and yes we all laugh about checking the meme stocks when we come into the morning.</p>

<p>It speaks of the speculative fervor that in some areas of the market is back.</p>

<p>Isn’t that the exact opposite of the conversation we were having just about a month ago when the Fed’s tightening policy.</p>

<p>You don’t want to be in those areas and yet we’ve seen a renaissance.</p>

<p>So what signal does that send more broadly.</p>

<p>Nice security there.</p>

<p>Kailey Leinz let’s have you bring in Victoria Fernandez chief market strategist across Mark Global Investments out of Rice in Texas S.M..</p>

<p>Ms.</p>

<p>Hernandez understands speculative fever.</p>

<p>Kelly pick it up please.</p>

<p>Well Victoria just to that point the behavior we have seen not just in those more speculative assets but really just risk assets in general this equity market rallying is in a bear market rally to you or is it something you can actually buy.</p>

<p>Yeah I’m not 100 percent convinced that this is a sustainable rally at this point in time.</p>

<p>Kaylie I mean you look at some of the signals that that you want to see when you hit that bottom and then you get a sustainable rally.</p>

<p>And a week and a half ago we didn’t have many of those.</p>

<p>We’re getting a few more of them.</p>

<p>Now you’re looking at the number of stocks making their 20 day highs.</p>

<p>You’re looking at those that are trading above their 20 and their 50 day moving averages.</p>

<p>And those numbers are starting to move higher into the ranges where you want to see them.</p>

<p>But I think when you’ve got this fed that is just determined to continue to raise rates until they really cause a little bit of pain within the labor market and bring that inflation number down then I think you have to be concerned that there’s still going to be some some volatility going around.</p>

<p>And the rally that we’ve seen in the market over the last month was really just driven by lower yields.</p>

<p>It wasn’t driven by earnings.</p>

<p>It wasn’t driven by equity premiums.</p>

<p>So I think you have to be careful because now as we’re seeing rates move a little bit higher that could cause some consternation for the equity markets.</p>

<p>OK so you’re essentially saying Victoria that the Fed is going to stamp this out that they are actually going to push back on loosening financial conditions because they want them tighter and they may be more aggressive than just saying the words as we’ve heard over the last week and change.</p>

<p>I think that’s absolutely correct.</p>

<p>I mean look financial conditions are looser now than they were in March when we started this.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be that way.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>We should have seen those continue to get tighter and tighter as the Fed moves rates up.</p>

<p>But look you had the CPI and the PPA reports.</p>

<p>Yes it was positive but I don’t think it is any kind of game changer for the Fed.</p>

<p>I mean month over month CPI didn’t go higher.</p>

<p>OK that’s great.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean that we’re actually on this downward trajectory for that number for those economic report.</p>

<p>So I think the Fed is going to continue to do the rate hikes.</p>

<p>I mean is it 50 or 75.</p>

<p>I mean I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Flip a coin at this point.</p>

<p>I don’t think it makes too much of a difference in the market reaction.</p>

<p>The important thing is the trend here and the trend I think is going to continue to be higher.</p>

<p>The reports coming out next month will be key.</p>

<p>I think in determining which one of those hikes we see said do you play this in real time Victoria.</p>

<p>To basically push against big tech to push against some of the biggest gainers over the past few trading sessions.</p>

<p>Yeah you really got to watch those trends.</p>

<p>Lisa I mean you’ve got a lot of these names that have been beaten down so badly.</p>

<p>They’re doing better now but they’re still in downward trends.</p>

<p>And we’ve seen that in some of the discretionary names.</p>

<p>We’ve seen it in some of the industrial names.</p>

<p>So I think you want to be careful and be really choosy when you go in there.</p>

<p>We still like some of the like HMO and insurance names something like a Cigna or a MetLife.</p>

<p>We like some of the consumer staple names.</p>

<p>Probably our most recent purchase we’ve done across some of our large cap strategies is Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>And again we’re focusing on these balance sheets.</p>

<p>We’re focusing on their debt ratios on the quality of their earnings.</p>

<p>We think this is where you’re going to find some advantage if we continue to have some volatility and the Fed keeping their foot on the gas to Victoria.</p>

<p>We’re about 90 some odd percent all through this earnings season.</p>

<p>I just did a stock mover that Tom called the worst ever because it was not full of really big names.</p>

<p>And they’re all these little stories that tell a very different story of how strong or weak the economy is how much to earnings matter as you talk more about the Fed and how much they’re going to push back against the overall rally.</p>

<p>It didn’t matter as much this past month as I actually thought they were.</p>

<p>I mean like we said most of the rally was driven by the move lower in yields but I think it was because we thought margins would get compressed a little bit more.</p>

<p>We thought we would see earnings revisions come in more than what we did during the second quarter.</p>

<p>And it wasn’t a great earnings season.</p>

<p>But I think it was better than people expected.</p>

<p>So it allowed to give a little bit of support to the market.</p>

<p>But going forward we are seeing those revisions come in for the second half of this year and for early 2023.</p>

<p>So I think it’s going to pay a play a bigger role going forward as we see corporations margins really start to get hit.</p>

<p>We’re hearing about layoffs.</p>

<p>So those are some concerns.</p>

<p>But look let’s say you watch the bond market closely as do I and spreads have actually started to tighten a little bit.</p>

<p>So the bond market is telling us they’re not too concerned right now.</p>

<p>I think it’s going to be an interesting battle as we go through the next earnings season.</p>

<p>Victoria I want to pick up on Lisa said there because I think it is a I’m making a joke about Lisa’s equity.</p>

<p>I think it was sterling actually folks for your Oscar consideration.</p>

<p>But Victoria seriously here should I lose viewers and listeners pay any attention to the bed bath and Beyond to the world.</p>

<p>Or should they focus on Apple.</p>

<p>I mean which matters.</p>

<p>Well I think it depends on what your perspective is as an investor.</p>

<p>If you’re going in there and you’re really trying to do this daily trading and you’re and you’re trying to be very much on top of the momentum and the trends then I think it does pay to look at some of these more main type of stocks just to get an idea of where the retail traders are in kind of the volatility on a day to day basis.</p>

<p>When you’re looking a little bit longer term and I know you were speaking with David Liebowitz earlier about you know three year being the new short term.</p>

<p>But if you’re looking three five years out then I think you’ve got to look at some of these bigger players.</p>

<p>I mean Apple has become such a large holding in the index.</p>

<p>I think it’s at the largest percentage that it’s ever been.</p>

<p>You’ve got to watch these names and see what their momentum is looking like and follow those trends.</p>

<p>So for us.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Going to be looking a little bit more towards those big player.</p>

<p>What does Coca Cola’s attributes.</p>

<p>It makes an apple like yeah I mean look you’ve got this global player.</p>

<p>You have a strong balance sheet.</p>

<p>And what did they say when their earnings I mean their earnings were pretty stellar.</p>

<p>And a point in time when many people were concerned about the consumer and they’re saying we’re not really seeing that.</p>

<p>You had a lot of companies talk about the dollar being a strong headwind.</p>

<p>Coca Cola’s managing that as well.</p>

<p>So if you look at something that’s considered a staple in this market an environment where you’re expecting volatility and then it from a company that says they’re seeing still a strong consumer going forward I think that’s a name you can have in your portfolio and feel pretty confident about it.</p>

<p>Victor thank you so much.</p>

<p>Victoria Fernandez across from global investors they’re fired up about what to do next.</p>

<p>And least to me you know really that is what this August Friday is about is as you mentioned earlier and I get the idea of framing out the year in just framing up past Labor Day now as a reach.</p>

<p>Honestly it could be one data point that everyone shifts off once again.</p>

<p>You know we got this wage tracker a data from the Atlanta Fed yesterday.</p>

<p>It did not show any slowing down whatsoever.</p>

<p>In fact it was pretty much steady and under the hood.</p>

<p>There were signs of strength.</p>

<p>At what point do people key into that.</p>

<p>At what point do people key into if oil prices start to climb again does that change the entire narrative to your point.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>This is my quarter.</p>

<p>He said Kelly jump in here as well.</p>

<p>Do no class or wage trackers.</p>

<p>Are they nothing more than marketing efforts by central banks.</p>

<p>I mean I just don’t you know we’ve got forty seven indices now all competing with each other to tell us where we are.</p>

<p>Do they have any value.</p>

<p>It’s a fair question Tom especially as we hear Federal Reserve official after Federal Reserve official saying forward guidance has gone.</p>

<p>We’re just going to depend on the data.</p>

<p>So how much is that really the hard data the economic data that crosses the wire.</p>

<p>And you see on Burke terminal versus these casts of all various shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>I thought it was really interesting that interview we had with Mary Daly the exclusive Kathleen Hays.</p>

<p>And she said pointing out there is another CPI read there is another jobs report before we can even get to the September meeting.</p>

<p>So a data dependent Fed is going to wait for more before making a call.</p>

<p>This week alone is not going to do it.</p>

<p>What’s really important folks you’re going to see this rolled out on Monday.</p>

<p>The Brown go back to school now.</p>

<p>Really looking.</p>

<p>What did you call it.</p>

<p>Advertising propaganda.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world to the best read.</p>

<p>I’m sure you can check.</p>

<p>There was a report that among the items FBI agents searched for at Donald Trump’s Florida home were classified documents related to nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>According to The Washington Post people familiar with the investigation didn’t say if those documents were found.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed.</p>

<p>President Biden wants four more years.</p>

<p>Bloomberg’s land.</p>

<p>The president is set to launch his reelection campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections.</p>

<p>Those close to Bloomberg say he’s encouraged by recent legislative economic and foreign policy successes.</p>

<p>But polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate.</p>

<p>Today the Rhine River is likely to shrink to a level that could disrupt the transport of fuel throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The effects could ripple through the continent for months.</p>

<p>The water level at a key waypoint west of Frankfurt is set to go below about 16 inches and continued dwindling.</p>

<p>That makes it uneconomical for barges carrying coal and oil to transit the river.</p>

<p>France is calling on the European Union for help in fighting wildfires that have been blazing for days.</p>

<p>Germany Greece Poland Romania and Austria are sending resources.</p>

<p>France is in the worst drought on record.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in England a summer of heatwaves has led the government to declare that large parts of the country are in a drought.</p>

<p>England recorded its driest July since 1935.</p>

<p>And in China developers have suffered a meltdown of at least 90 billion dollars in stocks and dollar bonds this year.</p>

<p>And a bursting housing bubble and a debt crisis may make matters worse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Beijing a signal that homeowners are the priority of efforts to stabilize the slumping housing market not build this global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries and which could get to.</p>

<p>This has been back.</p>

<p>This is the biggest concern above energy and that is food costs.</p>

<p>You look at the potential harvest this fall.</p>

<p>Not only is offroad diesel price for farmers rising.</p>

<p>Farm equipment is rising.</p>

<p>All of our costs.</p>

<p>So we’re looking at continued food costs because we cannot alter our behavior when it comes to food.</p>

<p>You can of gasoline not with food.</p>

<p>Stephen Schork absolutely on fire.</p>

<p>I believe that was yesterday with the Schork Report.</p>

<p>I really can’t say enough about the granularity of his effort.</p>

<p>And he is on absolute fire about natural gas dynamics right now.</p>

<p>We welcome all of your most interesting Friday.</p>

<p>We’re reading Emily Chang.</p>

<p>I’m reading all weekend and revision to try to figure out that disaster Kailey Leinz in for John Farrell.</p>

<p>John.</p>

<p>John is like back Monday.</p>

<p>Kelly right.</p>

<p>I mean affirmative.</p>

<p>I at the very least Tom I will not be.</p>

<p>I talked to him at the Rome airport.</p>

<p>I really have lost track of where he is now.</p>

<p>But I believe there has been a pharaoh sighting on a recapitulation we just talked about.</p>

<p>And we’ll have team coverage of this on Bloomberg Radio later.</p>

<p>And that is the Brando Back to school now cast.</p>

<p>This is a series that’s being put together by Bloomberg surveillance.</p>

<p>Alisa this begins with the haircuts that our parents never imagined what it would cost.</p>

<p>Yeah I took my my 13 year old son to get his haircut and I had a full bar there and it was sort of a real back to school.</p>

<p>Welcome for the parent.</p>

<p>I do wonder though as we talk about now Cassie you really think it’s propaganda marketing material for different Fed shops.</p>

<p>I think they’re taking well-intentioned time series and trying to brand them to media.</p>

<p>I’ll take the Cleveland CPI which I adore the great work of Cleveland.</p>

<p>Guilty as charged for us.</p>

<p>And they’ve got a mark thing as well.</p>

<p>All I remember is the biggest problem with back to school supplies was sixteen Creoles or 24 rich kids had 24 Creoles and one guy had seventy two Creole.</p>

<p>Is there I was Lisa was sixteen Creole.</p>

<p>And we’ll call Dr.</p>

<p>Phil after the dog chewed the magenta right now.</p>

<p>Dennis Gartman joins me with futures up 14.</p>

<p>Always good to speak.</p>

<p>The gentleman chairman of the University of Akron’s Endowment Fund.</p>

<p>He’s retired.</p>

<p>No he’s not.</p>

<p>He’s still writing the Gartman letter on an hour by hour basis and joins us today.</p>

<p>Dennis Lisa wants to talk about bonds.</p>

<p>I want to talk about hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>You know they’re out of control in Europe.</p>

<p>They’ve got a modest matter of a war.</p>

<p>Are we going to see methane natural gas.</p>

<p>Are we going to see different forms of gasoline in America.</p>

<p>Surge like electricity in France.</p>

<p>Probably so.</p>

<p>Propane is probably going to go a lot higher.</p>

<p>Nat gas is probably going to go a lot higher.</p>

<p>Inventories are extremely limited here in the United States.</p>

<p>They’re unbelievably limited in Europe.</p>

<p>If we start pushing nearby nat gas through nine dollars per million British thermal units nor trading about eight dollars and fifty eight dollars and 60 cents per million British thermal units if we start moving through nine dollars you start to go back to where we were in 2005 2006 and 2007 when we get 13 dollars per million British thermal units.</p>

<p>So you have to be very careful.</p>

<p>Things are very tight and likely to get tighter.</p>

<p>So it’s it’s not a pretty sign out there right now.</p>

<p>And you’re talking about natural gas and ISE but it could also apply this to certain oil inventory reports.</p>

<p>There are some different ones.</p>

<p>And I wonder how much we are fragile heading into the winter to see a spike in oil that could reverse some of the optimism about the disinflation that we’ve seen in this week’s reports.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on the term structure.</p>

<p>That’s that tells you more than anything else about what goes on in crude oil specifically especially historical commodities such as crude oil.</p>

<p>We’re in a small backwardation we were in and the larger backwardation a month and a half ago the backwardation has narrowed.</p>

<p>But in the past couple days as prices could all have fallen just a little bit taken we got what WTI and eighty eight dollars per barrel the other day and the nearby backwardation began to widen marginally.</p>

<p>Backwardation is where sophisticated and informed money leaves its footprints.</p>

<p>And if the backwardation starts to widen a bit we’re going to start seeing crude oil start to go higher again.</p>

<p>So I think you’ve seen most of the decline in crude oil NIKKEI did upon a decline in driving.</p>

<p>Miles here in the United States is the demand and decline in demand for gasoline and diesel.</p>

<p>I think you start to see it.</p>

<p>Eighty eight dollars a barrel.</p>

<p>That’s probably the low.</p>

<p>And I bet I bet we trade 95 96 97 and not too distant future.</p>

<p>So keep an eye on the backwardation.</p>

<p>A widening backwardation is always bullish for the crude oil market.</p>

<p>Well so let’s transfer that a 95 96 dollar a barrel a barrel price forecast here into your projection for the economy from markets especially because a lot of the trading activity has hinged on this lower oil price.</p>

<p>How much does that reverse the gains that we’ve seen in stocks and send yields higher.</p>

<p>I’m afraid that we’ve seen that the the the low on yields we’re going to see the much higher prices and yields much much lower prices and bond.</p>

<p>You had something that occurred last week which I think not enough people paying attention to.</p>

<p>You had an outsider reversal a week and outside a rehearsal day and the long bond future.</p>

<p>Very rare circumstance.</p>

<p>We’ve only seen a one time before here and we’ve only seen it two or three times in the course of the last five or six years.</p>

<p>When you have an outsider reversal I pay attention to it.</p>

<p>It’s one of the it’s one of the technicals that I pay great.</p>

<p>A great deal of need to an outsider.</p>

<p>Reversal week is a very rare event.</p>

<p>Probably means lower bond prices probably means higher yields over the course of next several weeks the next several months.</p>

<p>Be careful.</p>

<p>And I think that that’s the.</p>

<p>The decline that we’ve had in the long bond for the long bond yields over the course of last month and a half was predicated upon a decline in inflation decline in crude oil prices declining grain prices decline in livestock prices a decline in copper prices and all those turning around and turning back to the upside.</p>

<p>So be careful out there.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on gold.</p>

<p>It starts to get to 1825.</p>

<p>The game changes completely.</p>

<p>Well Dennis we know the story in the first half of the year was when yields go up it’s bad for the equity market.</p>

<p>That is why we saw growth stocks underperforming to such a degree.</p>

<p>They have staged a pretty remarkable comeback over the last month is essentially what you’re saying.</p>

<p>If yields are going higher from here that’s not going to last much longer.</p>

<p>I don’t think it last much longer.</p>

<p>As the chairman of the University of in that I got us to move a good 14 or 15 percent of the portfolio out.</p>

<p>We got very lucky we did on in December 30.</p>

<p>And as I’ve always said but in a bear market he or she who loses the least will be the winner.</p>

<p>We’ve lost less than most other endowments.</p>

<p>We have a meeting next week.</p>

<p>And I’m probably going to say we need to reduce our exposure just a tad more.</p>

<p>You’re going to reduce equities.</p>

<p>You’re going to reduce equity exposure even with this ginormous rally we’ve seen from June 16th.</p>

<p>Dennis at the margin probably another one or two or three percent.</p>

<p>Nothing dramatic nothing extraordinary.</p>

<p>But I think the rally has been a real bear market.</p>

<p>The volume has not been as illustrative or as dramatic as it should be on an EPS on a move to the upside.</p>

<p>And over the course of the past six months or seven months volume seems to come in on the downside rather than on the upside.</p>

<p>Another technical circumstance to pay attention to.</p>

<p>So I’m going to my position would be that I’d like to reduce our exposure just a tad weather and get the rest of the committee to agree is another story.</p>

<p>What do you do with it.</p>

<p>What do you do with the rest of it.</p>

<p>Buy options in the Cincinnati Reds or do you go into cash.</p>

<p>What do you do.</p>

<p>There’s a good game last night and watching the Cincinnati Reds.</p>

<p>But I think cash is probably not a bad place to be.</p>

<p>In fact I think cash is a very good place to be.</p>

<p>Cash being two year bonds and under two year treasuries and under Dow Jones Bill Cosby you continue to invert.</p>

<p>It’s been inverted for now for a month and a half.</p>

<p>You know it’s probably and I think the twos versus is get to it gets to 80 basis points without too much difficulty.</p>

<p>Dennis we’ve heard that this week.</p>

<p>Thank you so much.</p>

<p>Dennis Gartman with us from the University of Akron Endowment Fund and of course the acclaimed Gartman letter as well.</p>

<p>Lisa I’m glad Dennis brings that up because that’s really the salient call of the week as we’ve heard people extend out from premium miseries courageous negative 40 basis points negative 50 basis points to some ginormous inversion.</p>

<p>The underlying question is how much of the move that we’ve seen in markets is purely because of the decline in oil prices.</p>

<p>OK I go that.</p>

<p>I think we’ve got to work on the weekend Lisa you and I got to put together the brand of gloom cast.</p>

<p>I think you’re right.</p>

<p>You give your inputs and I’ll give mine.</p>

<p>You need to stay with us.</p>

<p>Paul Sankey will join us on oil soon.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>To continue to hear hawkish comments from the Fed because they need to have credibility to keep inflation expectations in check.</p>

<p>We might be going in a better direction than people thought.</p>

<p>We don’t think we’re kind of in the clear.</p>

<p>With respect to risks not yet convinced that price pressures have peaked.</p>

<p>The debate on inflation has peaked.</p>

<p>I think that’s over.</p>

<p>And now it’s a debate on how fast it comes down.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz What’d You Miss? sentiment kind of Friday.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>This is at Bloomberg Surveillance for our audience worldwide live on Bloomberg Television and Radio.</p>

<p>Tom Keene.</p>

<p>John Farrell.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>John.</p>

<p>Out.</p>

<p>We are so lucky to have Kailey Leinz here.</p>

<p>And Tom my takeaway from this week is how important gasoline prices have been to everything underpinning a lot of the rally that we’ve seen in both bonds and stocks simply said enough is about a gallon of gas.</p>

<p>Paul Sweeney has been very good about this is Bloomberg Surveillance on radio.</p>

<p>And Lisa you’re right it never can be said enough.</p>

<p>It seems old.</p>

<p>It seems dated.</p>

<p>We’re biased on the island of Manhattan.</p>

<p>Guess what.</p>

<p>We’re wrong.</p>

<p>It matters.</p>

<p>It matters from every point of view not only because it allows people to have more discretionary spending but that they’re not putting it toward the pump.</p>

<p>But also it affects things like that University of Michigan sentiment survey that we’re going to be getting at 10 a.m.</p>

<p>today.</p>

<p>It’s going to affect all of the inputs perhaps even next week with those retail sales.</p>

<p>Tom what are you watching for that pivot point to understand whether this rally is real.</p>

<p>I just I just I just don’t know.</p>

<p>I just think the news flow right now is extraordinary.</p>

<p>The reading over the weekend will be there at this hour.</p>

<p>We’ve got some great logos lined up just in the next 30 minutes folks.</p>

<p>You’ll hear from Paul Sankey on oil and the surge in natural gas.</p>

<p>And in moments Lisa Jeffrey you’ll join us Dani Burger.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kaylee how real is this.</p>

<p>How much trading is this in.</p>

<p>You talk to people all day long about exactly this question and how many people just come out and say it is so thin right now.</p>

<p>It is August.</p>

<p>Go home go on vacation because no one’s really out there making volumes.</p>

<p>Yeah everything seems more dramatic in the summertime because there’s just less people at play Lisa.</p>

<p>But there is starting to become a sense of that is shifting that this maybe is something more substantial.</p>

<p>The bear market rally narrative that was persistent for so long does feel like it’s morphing as the market sees this week as something of a turning point.</p>

<p>But in the Federal Reserve speak we have gotten it is not clear that policymakers agree.</p>

<p>Mary Daly and Neel Kashkari Charlie Evans all talking about how they think they have more work to do.</p>

<p>The fight against inflation is not over.</p>

<p>The market though doesn’t seem like they believe them.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And Tom what do you make of this that the more the market has to rally the more there is a Fed call the more that they’re going to come out and say we’re going to raise rates more.</p>

<p>Just to tell you guys that I underplay that.</p>

<p>I think the Fed is data dependent and they’ll be working off the economic data that they see.</p>

<p>And you know you know I don’t play Matt Miller attention to 75 beats or 50 beats here or there.</p>

<p>But I do think what is germane is where the finishing point is.</p>

<p>Within all this pontification is a three and a half percent or an a longer Bloomberg economics is way out of the lonely foreign three quarters or 5 percent.</p>

<p>I’m focused on the data this morning which is a positive tone to markets finishing up a week.</p>

<p>And it yesterday we saw that fade into the close.</p>

<p>Can we retain that today as people take a look at whether or not there is this disinflationary tilt across the board you’ve got S&amp;P up about four tenths of a percent the same as NASDAQ.</p>

<p>You have yields just a touch lower that to your yields is coming lower although yesterday that 10 year yield Tom actually rose after the auction.</p>

<p>It was an interesting auction because it was not met with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>And this shows the really risk of pushing back against some of the moves that we’ve seen to Dennis Garments point Gartman showed the ambivalence is out there I will say and this goes to what we’re going to address with Jeff you.</p>

<p>It’s about flow of money you mountains earlier lease.</p>

<p>And I think in the weekend literature we will see it.</p>

<p>The wall of money moving right now is tangible.</p>

<p>And right now out of cash into stocks into a credit.</p>

<p>And you are seeing a bit of a dollar strength reasserting itself after an incredible amount of weakness.</p>

<p>There is somebody who tracks this incredibly well and speaks incredibly articulately on this every time we have him on.</p>

<p>We are incredibly lucky to have Jeff you with our senior EMEA market strategist at BBY NY Mellon.</p>

<p>Jeff did anything change for you this week.</p>

<p>Not much for us.</p>

<p>You know we’re still holding on to the view that the Fed needs to keep expectations for several rates.</p>

<p>Could be awful.</p>

<p>Whether the next hike is relatively firm looking at 75 percent markets need to be on guard and need to be vigilant on this.</p>

<p>But your earlier point about flows obviously and changes risk on two very interesting developments one in ethics markets.</p>

<p>People are looking for quality.</p>

<p>What do I mean by quality.</p>

<p>Surplus economies not the larger ones.</p>

<p>The likes of Switzerland likes of Sweden the likes of Korea Singapore with healthy sub.</p>

<p>Says good balance of payments lower yields on strengthening currencies.</p>

<p>That’s what looking at.</p>

<p>Secondly to your point about credit.</p>

<p>If we can borrow an equivalent in emerging market bonds probably on a hedged basis.</p>

<p>Clients are looking back as well.</p>

<p>Flow are showing ample buying of that.</p>

<p>So yes some risk on but only where it matters.</p>

<p>And anyway this quality Jeff quality makes me think the dollar.</p>

<p>Yet the dollar is what sold off yesterday.</p>

<p>And that classic risk I’m telling.</p>

<p>Do you expect the dollar to reassert its strength or do you continue to see the risk on being paired with a weaker dollar.</p>

<p>Well I still think the dollar is quite strong right now.</p>

<p>If we look at where your dollar is.</p>

<p>If we look at where a dollar sterling is Michael Barr dollar yen as you know even after the recent downward move that’s where the dollar is still asserting itself.</p>

<p>Donovan can be for example.</p>

<p>So whether the dollar should be asserting itself on a growth basis on an inflation and interest rates expectations basis.</p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>But it’s no longer the only game in town.</p>

<p>And I think that’s when money is being put to work.</p>

<p>Jeff for you as money moves around and repossessions and there’s a lot of heated debate is cash good asset to be an.</p>

<p>So cash right now is a less bad asset to be and your opportunity cost in earning cash is lower not only on a nominal basis because of high rates of both but on a risk adjusted basis as well.</p>

<p>So I think people are realizing the value of cash rather than that fear of missing out.</p>

<p>I need to be as underweight cash as possible.</p>

<p>So that will have implications for the structure of markets as well.</p>

<p>These short volatility products know what you’re trying to pick up your son yield on your paper by selling options or things like that.</p>

<p>Those are going to be taken off and I think that’s actually healthy for the market as well.</p>

<p>But over medium to longer Tom Mackenzie time horizon I think people again are putting money to work.</p>

<p>How do you respond to the efficacy of a two part market where quality wins persistent cash flows wins and everything else doesn’t.</p>

<p>And the ability to pick those stocks.</p>

<p>Can you get away with that.</p>

<p>Well not if it’s stocks or currency or a bond you really have to show your value right now.</p>

<p>For companies and for countries.</p>

<p>Show me where reform is.</p>

<p>Show me where your plans are.</p>

<p>Show me how you’re going to improve your cash flow.</p>

<p>Show me how you are going to be able to offset your costs of your your rising cost either through internal productivity growth or let’s take the example of Europe for example.</p>

<p>How can you lift your trenberth and how can you get out of a situation whereby people are fundamentally reassessing the quality and the euro.</p>

<p>The eurozone is running a trade deficit against non eurozone countries.</p>

<p>When was the last time that happened.</p>

<p>On a sustained basis.</p>

<p>So what is plan B for growth.</p>

<p>It’s now showing the plan is not sustainable.</p>

<p>It’s not going to work.</p>

<p>So that’s where the internal changes need to happen.</p>

<p>On a micro and macro level if you don’t have quality right in.</p>

<p>Show me a plan where you can obtain quality again.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Jeff I’m glad you brought up Europe because I got my electricity bill earlier this week in my ISE mildly bugged out of my head when I received it.</p>

<p>And yet I thought at least it could be worse instead of New York.</p>

<p>I could live in London or elsewhere in Europe where the energy situation is far worse.</p>

<p>We had a headline crossing the Bloomberg earlier about most of England being declared in drought.</p>

<p>We have the Rhine River that is expected later today to have such a low water level.</p>

<p>It becomes impassible at one critical point.</p>

<p>How doomed is Europe.</p>

<p>Well let’s start with the UK.</p>

<p>So 5000 pounds per year in energy bills where household disposable income is depending where you obviously 30 to 35 thousand pounds.</p>

<p>On top of that mortgage payments potentially increasing by 2000 3000 pounds a year.</p>

<p>Post-tax them by the way.</p>

<p>So that is problematic.</p>

<p>And right now does and it’s to say a lot of a lack of government rather than a lack of vision that they’re going to push things through.</p>

<p>Europe is not doing the same because there are stabilizers in place now.</p>

<p>There are a longstanding fiscal plans to help the household but it comes at a cost.</p>

<p>If the household is going to be protected that industry will have to suffer as a result of gas rationing for example for the chemicals industry in open Germany for the auto industry that is coming suddenly talk about the filling up to stop the inefficiency element that long wasted gentlemen earlier.</p>

<p>But at the same time I think fundamental changes are needed and not by fear for the eurozone is that downside scenario.</p>

<p>Madam Mogahed talked about where growth will contract by one point seven percent next year.</p>

<p>This is swiftly becoming if not already markets call case 2023.</p>

<p>In the eurozone.</p>

<p>Jeffrey thank you so much.</p>

<p>Really appreciate it would be NY Mellon and Lisa as we move to Jackson all here the Fed speak is going to be fascinating.</p>

<p>I mean you know we’re distant from that September meeting and between the Fed dialogue not so much a Jackson Hole but tangential to it like we heard from Mary Daly getting the tealeaves here not for the parlor game but just sort of the mood of the nation will be critical.</p>

<p>Do they see the risks still as being greater that they could pause too soon and allow a repeat of the 1970s.</p>

<p>Or do they see a risk of curtailing the economy more greatly and having that kind of erode the balance of errors is what I’m watching from those tealeaves anyway and translate that into the inflation path.</p>

<p>And you know the physics and the economics Liz it’s about inertial force.</p>

<p>It’s not talk so much but just the inertial force of disinflation.</p>

<p>And the idea that that’s a smooth curve down to 5 percent or 4 percent or dare I say down to 2 percent is just delusional.</p>

<p>Well the inertial force in France is not going in the right direction and the inertial force and food is not going in the right direction.</p>

<p>So there are inertial forces that are working against them.</p>

<p>And then if you get the oil price climbing how much does that really cold so-called what.</p>

<p>Throw some cold water over the narrative that way.</p>

<p>I mean we haven’t even talked about it yet.</p>

<p>December 14th that’s a meeting.</p>

<p>What if there’s a pause in this descent of inflation.</p>

<p>We get what do we get there.</p>

<p>We get one two three I think for inflation reports before December 14th.</p>

<p>What if we stop this inflating that’s not in the dialogue.</p>

<p>And what if we get an Adam Posen ask idea at Jackson Hole that they would be okay with 3 percent or that would be a bombshell.</p>

<p>Now you’re making some news there.</p>

<p>I’m not making news.</p>

<p>I’m just I mean evacuating the Bears.</p>

<p>The Bears have come out of the forest and listen.</p>

<p>Blizzard.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that come out.</p>

<p>It’s very.</p>

<p>How many others.</p>

<p>The pheasant Tom Keene.</p>

<p>I know you don’t want anything.</p>

<p>Late August the pheasant of Jackson Hole.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first red I’m risky Gupta.</p>

<p>FBI agents reportedly searched Donald Trump’s Florida home for classified documents related to nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>That’s according to The Washington Post.</p>

<p>The newspaper says people familiar with the probe didn’t say if the documents were recovered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed.</p>

<p>Beanbags on the president.</p>

<p>Biden is preparing to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections.</p>

<p>That sets up a potential rematch with Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Those close to President Biden described him as upbeat about recent legislative economic and foreign policy victories.</p>

<p>Polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate.</p>

<p>San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley says the killer inflation reading for July is welcome and she believes it may be appropriate for the Fed to slow its interest rate increase to 50 basis points next month.</p>

<p>Still Daley told Bloomberg TV the fight against inflation is far from over.</p>

<p>She says rate hikes need to be dependent on data.</p>

<p>Three of China’s biggest state owned companies planned to delist from U.S.</p>

<p>exchanges.</p>

<p>That fallout from a dispute over whether American regulators should be allowed to inspect audits of Chinese businesses that are listed in the US.</p>

<p>The three companies that will delist China like China and Sinopec the way has been cleared for Samsung vice chairman Jihye Lee to formally take the helm of the electronics conglomerate.</p>

<p>South Korea’s president use skill cleared the add to the country’s biggest company of bribery charges.</p>

<p>Lee spent 18 months in prison before his release on parole a year ago.</p>

<p>Going to use 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries on which you could get to.</p>

<p>This is Glenn Beck.</p>

<p>I have a baseline case going into September that is 50 basis points that’s where I’d been since the last meeting but I have an open mind about whether 75 is going to be necessary and a lot of that will depend on the labor market information and whether we start to see those things slow enough to say while we’ve got the momentum right.</p>

<p>Surely our most interesting president of the Federal Reserve Bank Mary Daley has an original story in San Francisco.</p>

<p>And of course a huge shoes to fill there.</p>

<p>John Williams and she is front and center on the social sensitivities of all of this economic mumbo jumbo.</p>

<p>We talk of futures up 19 on a Friday.</p>

<p>Dow futures up 126 less.</p>

<p>I mean call it a persistent lift.</p>

<p>And it’s not off of you know CPI Wednesday or whatever we’ve got here.</p>

<p>It’s just a nice lift in the market.</p>

<p>It comes from all of the reassessments that people are going to be talking about over the weekend about whether there is more disinflation than they previously thought.</p>

<p>One hundred dollar print number and crude earlier 97 98 now down a dollar sixty.</p>

<p>A wobbling of hydrocarbons this morning.</p>

<p>That gets us to Paul Sankey founder and lead analyst of Sankey Research with decades and decades of experience of the Michael Barr economic analysis of all this.</p>

<p>Paul how close is America to the many deviation leaps that we’re seeing in European hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>Are we dealing at or linked to those war events.</p>

<p>Well the good news is you know Tom is that we produce a vast amount of oil and gas here.</p>

<p>So ten years ago we were that’s importers of 8 million barrels a day of oil.</p>

<p>Believe it or not.</p>

<p>Now we’re net neutral.</p>

<p>So the U.S.</p>

<p>oil and gas industry has done a phenomenal job not only of oil but we’re also now the world’s largest natural gas exports.</p>

<p>And as you know the problem in Europe is that they really don’t produce a whole lot of domestic energy.</p>

<p>Full stop.</p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>They stop their nuclear and coal so they get into their own problems.</p>

<p>So the big pull here is going to be a concern which is exports to Europe.</p>

<p>Whether or not that drives you think local gas prices very high ISE.</p>

<p>Natural gas prices very high is quite Paul Sweeney.</p>

<p>You can pass a barrel of oil like no one.</p>

<p>Let’s wander over to methane and natural gas.</p>

<p>When Paul Sweeney uses energy one go from two to eight.</p>

<p>What does that signal for you.</p>

<p>Probably that we’re going to send the price in Europe as you know is more like 50 or FTSE you.</p>

<p>I mean extraordinary prices.</p>

<p>So the draw there if it costs you about five six seven eight dollars to cross the Atlantic there’s obviously implicitly a massive pull on our exports.</p>

<p>And that’s I think going to be sufficiently large to pressure natural gas prices into Windsor.</p>

<p>It now becomes a question of whether we’ve got hurricane season which hasn’t really happened yet at all.</p>

<p>And then of course the really concerning question and it’s a major concern is how cold it gets this winter.</p>

<p>And if we get a globally cold winter that we’re going to have death I’m afraid.</p>

<p>Well that’s on the natural gas side.</p>

<p>And that’s a pretty dire projection on this Friday on the oil side.</p>

<p>The IEA saying the increasing number of gas relying electricity providers are turning to gas to oil prices to oil in order to stave off some of the shortages.</p>

<p>How underfunded is this market.</p>

<p>How cheap is this market relative to where it will be ISE the end of this year.</p>

<p>The U.S.</p>

<p>price I mean is way below that said I mean you know as I said we’re over 50 dollars per Emily Chang more or less in Europe.</p>

<p>And quite possibly go higher based on what Tom and I were just discussing European electricity prices.</p>

<p>They’ve they’re just you know they’ve gone as you said exponential essentially.</p>

<p>But I mean in terms of oil prices that’s where I was going with this with this idea that this is inflationary input.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>So the oil situation is a bit different because essentially Russia makes more money from oil and continues to supply oil to the market.</p>

<p>So the oil crisis is not a crisis to the extent that the gas crisis is.</p>

<p>So there’s going to be a major pressure upwards on natural gas prices at the moment.</p>

<p>There is marginal use of oil which the IEA has highlighted as you said not least.</p>

<p>Propane for example is a direct substitute for natural gas but also generally the use of oil and coal is going to be driven by by the problems in Europe.</p>

<p>No question.</p>

<p>It’s just that the Russians really haven’t reduced the supply of oil anything like what they’ve done to the natural gas side.</p>

<p>Paul here in the United States later today the House is expected to pass the Inflation Reduction Act and eventually the president simply will sign it.</p>

<p>The measures within that some of them including the tax on methane emissions.</p>

<p>How do you expect that could impact the supply landscape here in the U.S..</p>

<p>It’s significant.</p>

<p>It’s split the industry.</p>

<p>So the big the big oil’s the excellence of Chevron and Conoco Phillips already have very strong methane limits and continue to pursue zero flaring as a target for example.</p>

<p>And then you have this enormous tale of companies.</p>

<p>I think the six thousand U.S.</p>

<p>oil and gas companies of which I can only name 50.</p>

<p>So if at best.</p>

<p>So this enormous tail is under direct threat and it could be assuming that it passes and that is implemented strongly.</p>

<p>It will be a major pressure to the downside on marginal U.S.</p>

<p>gas production.</p>

<p>No question.</p>

<p>So is there a threat that the inflation reduction act at least when it comes to energy prices actually becomes more inflationary.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Paul it Erick.</p>

<p>Paul I think we probably should leave it there.</p>

<p>Tom what do you say.</p>

<p>I think Paul you think you’re on short notice for joining us here today with what has been underreported in the American press.</p>

<p>I’m not going to mince words about it.</p>

<p>Natural gas sustained here.</p>

<p>You know I don’t use the units because they’re British thermal units.</p>

<p>And you know I have to wear a bathing suit or something if I quote those.</p>

<p>But little Lisa the fact is just looking at the measurement of natural gas off energy one different than Netherlands is two to eight.</p>

<p>Dennis Gartman talking about nine.</p>

<p>And I believe Paul he said there we would move right through to 10.</p>

<p>And that’s got a huge issue.</p>

<p>And particularly Lisa was substitution.</p>

<p>We’re nowhere near the coal substitution you’re seeing in Europe right now.</p>

<p>But you wonder is that is that a 2023 story.</p>

<p>Coal substitution or oil substitution.</p>

<p>And that’s what I was trying to get at.</p>

<p>You’re seeing that increasingly threatens Germany.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I know but go ahead.</p>

<p>Going forward are you going to see an increasing amount of that in the United States as well.</p>

<p>Kind of pushing against this push to stay a step away from the fossil fuel burning sources of energy.</p>

<p>Honestly I think that there’s going to have to be some sort of adjustments whether that’s going to reverse some of the gains some of the losses that we’ve seen recently in the price of oil.</p>

<p>We’re going to continue on here.</p>

<p>We’ve got another good half hour here.</p>

<p>Bloomberg Surveillance on to other projects.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowicz getting real with a real yield today.</p>

<p>Drew Matus will come up is well.</p>

<p>But you know I got to say having Caylee here has been very beneficial.</p>

<p>And of course we’ve seen you make a men’s team spirit visible on television for those you in radio.</p>

<p>There’s an extraordinary moment yesterday where Lisa and Caylee just wanted to.</p>

<p>Hi I don’t know what’s in the record day hiding as a game.</p>

<p>I am winning.</p>

<p>There were the beverage of my choice on the couch last night with that bill.</p>

<p>And Maria Tadeo calls up from Barcelona and says my Spanish was wrong.</p>

<p>Are you really conjugate tomorrow.</p>

<p>I felt.</p>

<p>What is this photo about on radio.</p>

<p>It’s appalling.</p>

<p>They literally want to hide.</p>

<p>I mean look at the banner.</p>

<p>Who wouldn’t speak Spanish incorrectly about drinking in an election there.</p>

<p>It’s been a great week.</p>

<p>And we will see this I think is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>Bloomberg Surveillance on a Friday an important conversation coming up here with Drew Matus of Net Life as well.</p>

<p>Please help me with the day check.</p>

<p>Futures negative 19.</p>

<p>Dow Futures negative 123.</p>

<p>It’s auction free Friday Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>I see positive across the board.</p>

<p>Actually I think everything is is doing quite nicely and constructive at NASDAQ up about five tenths of a percent.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P up about the same.</p>

<p>A little bit of a bid into treasuries.</p>

<p>Basically the lift is not coming off data.</p>

<p>It is coming off this feeling that we are not getting as fast inflation.</p>

<p>We have hit peak inflation and the Fed is going to respond.</p>

<p>I would suggest Kailey Leinz it for John Farrow.</p>

<p>Kelly I would suggest that what we’ve seen here today and in the last couple days is flows in a lot of doubt about the persistency of the flows in the equities.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And you’ve seen that in the Bank of America data that Michael Hartnett put together seven point one billion dollars in global equity funds pulled in through August 10th which of course was the CPI day eleven point seven billion dollars worth of flows into bonds as well four point three billion pulled out of cash.</p>

<p>Tom if you’re still in triple leverage all cash seems like you might be the only one because a lot of people have decided at this stage this week and they’re putting money to work you know based on the hate mail I get.</p>

<p>I would say that’s it’s right.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty lonely position.</p>

<p>Truman joins us now to sort this out.</p>

<p>He is chief market strategist at MetLife.</p>

<p>But that barely describes what he and Maury Harris stood at UBS years ago in the depths of the great financial crisis where they suggested the American economy would piece together and would be resilient and would move forward over the coming decade.</p>

<p>Drew I look at the moment that we’re in right now in the one statistic that gets my attention is three ratios of productivity.</p>

<p>People like you seem to be very concerned about a dearth of productivity and inefficiency in the economy.</p>

<p>Is that evident or can we prosper.</p>

<p>I think it’s evident you know one of the things that’s most disturbing is actually that right now you have the GDP contracting right.</p>

<p>And we can off the recession as much as we want.</p>

<p>But GDP is contracting and yet we’re still hiring a ton of people.</p>

<p>And so many were hiring this people because the systems become so inefficient that without all those additional people you can actually get the job done.</p>

<p>And if that’s the case in Europe potential growth rate is declining.</p>

<p>And so it’s it’s bad news for the economy.</p>

<p>It’s bad news for long term inflation.</p>

<p>And it’s it’s bad news for kind of what the next recession might look like.</p>

<p>What does it mean for investment.</p>

<p>What does it mean for the greater actuarial assumption of someone like MetLife or the actual assumption of our viewers and listeners or we’re just trying to get to Labor Day.</p>

<p>Well if it’s sustained it’s kind of a lower trend growth story for the United States which is obviously not something we want we want to be in a high growth environment with modest inflation.</p>

<p>Because that’s what actually outperforms and creates the most wealth for an economy.</p>

<p>And of course workers benefit if they’re productive.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>And worker standard of living increases if people are productive.</p>

<p>If we’re not productive those things are going to decline.</p>

<p>And so.</p>

<p>You know I think from a kind of a very long term perspective it’s a negative for interest rates.</p>

<p>It’s a negative for growth in the U.S.</p>

<p>economy.</p>

<p>It’s negative for U.S.</p>

<p>competitiveness.</p>

<p>How long you remain gloomy Drew when you see the optimism being reflected in pretty much all of the markets.</p>

<p>You know I’ve got to say I’m kind of short term gloomy but long term very positive.</p>

<p>I think this blip in productivity is it’s just that I think it’s a situation where everyone’s trying to get used to kind of this new environment that we’re in.</p>

<p>And I think this new environment is actually an old environment.</p>

<p>We got so used to being service sector driven that we forgot that there are cycles in the economy that don’t pertain to services.</p>

<p>So there’s a manufacturing cycle and there’s inventory builds and inventory contractions.</p>

<p>And one of the things I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is.</p>

<p>You know.</p>

<p>Is everything we’re seeing really just a return to a kind of economic volatility that used to be the norm.</p>

<p>Let’s say before the 1990s.</p>

<p>So what do you bide your.</p>

<p>Well so that’s a great question because you know our nearer term forecast is that you know we’re not in a recession now but it’s coming and there’s going to be a calm before the storm which is kind of what we’re in right now.</p>

<p>And I think you know one of the one of the most important questions I think we’re trying to figure out right now is what the next recession looks like and how could it be how sustained could it be.</p>

<p>And more importantly then what the recovery is out of it.</p>

<p>So I don’t think now’s the time for caution because I do think you know what we’re seeing now is kind of a false dawn and that we’re going to get towards the end of the year we’re going to really begin to see people pull back on things like hiring and investments.</p>

<p>And that will affect the consumer and with the consumer will go the economy higher.</p>

<p>You know I thought.</p>

<p>I’m sorry.</p>

<p>Well just when you say the consumer I wonder what kind of consumer we’re really talking about because you have a company like Apple with Bloomberg reporting overnight that they’re telling suppliers make as many next generation iPhones this year as you did last year because affluent consumers are still going to be upgrading their phones.</p>

<p>Yet there is the lower end of the income spectrum which is struggling with higher food and gas prices.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s where the cutbacks on discretionary spending are coming from.</p>

<p>So if it’s a consumer led recession and is only actually part of the consumer base.</p>

<p>Well that’s always going to be the case.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>I mean when we think about the consumer what moves the needle and we consumers the middle class upper middle class because through the people who are actually very their consumption they get worried about their job.</p>

<p>They cut back on things.</p>

<p>You know the very rich and the very poor don’t actually change their consumption patterns very much.</p>

<p>In one case because they don’t need to add in the other case because they can’t.</p>

<p>And so it’s that it’s that middle grouping that moves the needle.</p>

<p>And you know I would say that you know that middle group is looking a little bit more stressed of late.</p>

<p>You’re seeing a pickup in things like credit card credit.</p>

<p>You’re seeing them balk at higher prices for various large ticket items.</p>

<p>And so they are making decisions that are that are preparing them for a potential downturn.</p>

<p>It just hasn’t really reached the level of momentum yet.</p>

<p>And of course you know every time they think that they should be preparing you know you get something you get some good news on something like the labor front.</p>

<p>But I do think they’re becoming increasingly nervous.</p>

<p>Will under you talk about momentum building we’ve already seen signs of that affecting corporations like Wal-Mart and Target warning on margins because of the very for margins because of the forces you are talking about when do we start to see that margin erosion.</p>

<p>More broadly do you think it’s coming.</p>

<p>Well so I mean if you if we look at economy wide margins and when you look at economy wide margins they have peaked and are coming off.</p>

<p>There’s some distortion caused by things like loan forgiveness.</p>

<p>So you have to kind of work through that a little bit.</p>

<p>But it does seem like economy wide margins have peaked and have begun to erode.</p>

<p>And when they erode enough you begin to see large larger scale pullbacks from companies hiring and investment.</p>

<p>And so it gets the clock ticking towards kind of a recession.</p>

<p>And once again they all kind of lines up with kind of like in 2023 date whether you’re looking at things like the yield curve or whether you’re looking at things like margins Drew all the consumer.</p>

<p>Do we go into retail sales next week.</p>

<p>It’s why we’ll see.</p>

<p>In the sea is a big big C++ G but it’s an ex.</p>

<p>What does consumption do.</p>

<p>Well I think you’re going to continue to see the move towards services.</p>

<p>People spent a lot of money on goods during during the Covid crisis and they’re moving towards services and you’re seeing that’s where the demand is.</p>

<p>The real question is this how much or how how long is that going to hold up.</p>

<p>I think that the movement is going to hold.</p>

<p>But what’s the overall level.</p>

<p>And I think the overall level is going to begin to decline a little bit as people begin to balk at higher prices.</p>

<p>See they’ve already done that with things like cars.</p>

<p>And you know the question is when will they begin to do it for things like air fares hotels the service experiences that have been holding up so well.</p>

<p>So where do you run at MetLife.</p>

<p>I mean know not to get into the nuances of your portfolio but what does it mean for bond prices to see that kind of economic view.</p>

<p>Well you know we focus a lot on credit here right.</p>

<p>So the goal for us is to kind of pick the assets that you’re going to pay back for holding.</p>

<p>And you know some of that payback is kind of what’s the yield on it and some of it that’s what’s the credit on it.</p>

<p>And so it’s a time to be a little concerned a little concerned and making sure you’re paying very close attention to the credit component making sure that you’re going to get paid back for him and taking the risk that you thought you were taking.</p>

<p>And so you know there’s various places you can do that.</p>

<p>Also an inflation environment.</p>

<p>You know real estate tends to be a nice inflation hedge.</p>

<p>And in my life you know we’re fortunate enough to have an agricultural business.</p>

<p>Agricultural lending business which also kind of provides some of that.</p>

<p>Just real quick do we only have about 30 seconds.</p>

<p>How frustrating is it to the market.</p>

<p>The entire market trades risk on risk off to a lower or higher or higher oil price.</p>

<p>Well it’s so frustrating so much as I think that you’re seeing the market respond to a return to economic volatility which most people who are trading on Wall Street today probably haven’t seen before.</p>

<p>We got very used to things moving in very long trend line movements with very little volatility around it.</p>

<p>And I think we’re returning to a period of much more akin to the 80s where you’re going to get a lot more volatility on a quarter by quarter basis in terms of growth.</p>

<p>And you have to look through that and really kind of do your homework in terms of who can handle that kind of volatility as they try to plan for the future.</p>

<p>Terrific brief.</p>

<p>Drew Matus thank you so much with MetLife Investment Management this morning Lisa.</p>

<p>Ben Emmons has been very strong this week writing of subtle notes really thoughtful on the path to Jackson Hole.</p>

<p>He calls it an August euphoric overshoot.</p>

<p>It sounds like something you wrote Lisa.</p>

<p>And what I would point to as you and I have followed is a Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index which is measured in standard deviations.</p>

<p>And Lisa.</p>

<p>It’s extraordinary from the equity bottom of moving from greater than one negative standard deviation in moments ago popping through a negative point to zero to a better statistic.</p>

<p>I mean it’s irrefutable what these financial conditions say they are loosening which is probably not what the Fed would like to see unless they are caught and they control it.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that you kidding.</p>

<p>Well they could control it.</p>

<p>They come out with a 1 percent rate hike in September.</p>

<p>They could control it if they come out and they actually make material moves to say you guys are wrong.</p>

<p>Whether they actually want to do that is another question.</p>

<p>The economy actually is right.</p>

<p>We’ll continue this conversation with Matt D out of Merrill and Bank of America by the bank.</p>

<p>Coming up I gonna tell you this conversation.</p>

<p>The Jackson Hole folks look for Lisa Abramowicz as exclusive interview with Jerome Powell.</p>

<p>It will be surveillance NIKKEI exclusive.</p>

<p>This is where she just will grill the chairman.</p>

<p>It’s such a 1 percent.</p>

<p>This is.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word on which you can get to.</p>

<p>That’s a report that amongst the items FBI agents search for Donald Trump’s Florida home where classified documents related to nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>According to The Washington Post people familiar with the investigation didn’t say those documents were found.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant.</p>

<p>The Justice Department has already asked for a court a court for the papers to be unsealed.</p>

<p>President Biden wants four more years.</p>

<p>Bloomberg slammed the president is set to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections.</p>

<p>Those close to Bloomberg say he’s encouraged by recent legislative economic and foreign policy successes.</p>

<p>But polls show most Democrats would rather have a never candidate.</p>

<p>Today the Rhine River is likely to shrink to a level that could disrupt the transport of fuel throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The effects can ripple through the continent for months.</p>

<p>The water level at a key route up Key Waypoint west of Frankfurt is set to go below about 16 inches and continue dwindling.</p>

<p>That makes it uneconomical for barges carrying coal and oil to transit the river.</p>

<p>Moscow is facing pushback from retailers over a new product for customers.</p>

<p>It allows them to pay off their purchases in installments.</p>

<p>MasterCard has told merchants on their banks that it will charge retailers three percent of a purchase price each time a consumer uses the new program which is less can still can opt out by now.</p>

<p>PPI latest service globally is 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries.</p>

<p>And you can get to.</p>

<p>This is back.</p>

<p>Markets are completely ignoring Fed speak right now.</p>

<p>They don’t want to hear it.</p>

<p>They fighting the Fed fighting the Fed.</p>

<p>I think you always need to bring the big guns out.</p>

<p>We need Powell to come out and speak until he speaks.</p>

<p>I think the market rally can keep going.</p>

<p>See Machar there was some optimism when principal global investors taking it down too.</p>

<p>When the chairman speaks in Jackson Hole we’re pleased to tell you that Lisa Abramowicz Jonathan Ferro and I will be at Jackson Hole with a team.</p>

<p>Michael McKee will join us is well really our major contact with the Federal Reserve of Kansas City and their academic meeting.</p>

<p>But we hope to make it more than academic for you.</p>

<p>We look for that in about 15 days.</p>

<p>Kailey Leinz in for Jonathan Ferro.</p>

<p>I’m Tom Keene and thank you so much for joining us.</p>

<p>With futures ever so slightly.</p>

<p>Doing a shoot see Machar advance up 19 right now.</p>

<p>Make that up 20 points on the Standard and Poor’s.</p>

<p>Dow futures up 139.</p>

<p>This is the conversation of the day for every American family on radio and TV.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the cost of airfare.</p>

<p>Helene Becker brings good news.</p>

<p>Senior research analyst at COWAN.</p>

<p>Helene you guys do definitive work that you and Kai Rumer invented which is measuring the air fares percent change.</p>

<p>You detect a crack.</p>

<p>Is it possible airfares could collapse come the autumn and winter.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say collapse but definitely come down where.</p>

<p>We’re already seeing them decline.</p>

<p>It looks like June July was the peak and we’ve seen what you call promotional fares come down after Labor Day.</p>

<p>They’re not as low as they were last fall.</p>

<p>Last fall we saw the most lowest.</p>

<p>Thirty nine dollars one way.</p>

<p>We’re seeing them.</p>

<p>Fifty nine dollars one way.</p>

<p>So they’re definitely come down and.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>If fuel prices go down they’ll continue to come down.</p>

<p>I’m looking for the 59 dollar ticket to see DG in Paris as well past domestic versus international.</p>

<p>So domestic is is significantly lower.</p>

<p>We’re seeing fares come down in October for international September still seems to be fairly high although I’ve noticed some really good deals if you want to go to places like Paris.</p>

<p>Haven’t seen much in the way of London.</p>

<p>London seems sold out but I’ve seen Paris I’ve seen Frankfurt Madrid Barcelona on unmarked down.</p>

<p>So there were places that have good sales for after Labor Day as well.</p>

<p>I’m guessing Tom’s going to spend a couple hours later on today searching prices for and take a spare.</p>

<p>I mean I don’t I don’t ever listen to our interviews back Kailey Leinz Becker.</p>

<p>I listen back like five times.</p>

<p>Take check Paris.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Well Helene you were just talking about how fuel prices have come down so that will have a bearing on fares.</p>

<p>Are you saying essentially that it’s more about the input costs that airlines are facing that dictate that rather than it being some kind of demand construction on the part of the traveler not being willing to pay higher fares anymore.</p>

<p>I think it’s a combination of both.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>I think that we’ve seen input costs especially fuel come down off the peak.</p>

<p>So that’s a good ISE that labor costs are still very high.</p>

<p>The Department of Transportation reported yesterday that in June the number of employees employed by airlines exceeded the number in 2019.</p>

<p>So we’re already back to pre pandemic levels of employment.</p>

<p>The fact that we’re seeing these huge delays continue just means that airports are still understaffed and whether on the East Coast is not helping.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>So think about it that way as far as demand goes.</p>

<p>We’re seeing very strong demand especially for ultra low cost airlines.</p>

<p>And we’re seeing what we’re calling trade down as people have relocated and they have to go back to their home office paying for tickets as gifts gets old fast.</p>

<p>So we’re definitely seeing trade down to the ultra low cost airlines.</p>

<p>And of course to your point.</p>

<p>Food costs are high.</p>

<p>Gasoline prices are high although I’ve heard they’ve come off.</p>

<p>The lows are the highs rather.</p>

<p>So maybe that makes a little more attractive for people to fly again.</p>

<p>Yeah but instead of taking five trips it’ll take four something like that.</p>

<p>But I got consumers get tired of High Flyers for sure.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And that definitely impacts the leisure side.</p>

<p>What about the business side.</p>

<p>Tom John and Lisa have their business class tickets booked to Jackson Hole in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Is everybody else doing that too.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I think what we’re seeing is business travel resume.</p>

<p>We might not be seeing five people going to that conference.</p>

<p>We may only see three but we’re definitely seeing an increase in business travel.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we were down still down 50 to 60 percent.</p>

<p>Now we’re down closer to 20 and 30 percent.</p>

<p>And a couple of the airlines and their recent earnings calls talked about it being down 15 to 20 percent.</p>

<p>So you’re seeing that increase especially as return to office happens as more people go back to their offices at least two days a week.</p>

<p>You’re seeing that travel come back.</p>

<p>Elaine I talked to Lisa Abramowicz this week in Broome.</p>

<p>So to me she said Tom you got to watch.</p>

<p>Guess who’s coming to dinner just to see the opening of the movie which is a magisterial United Airlines 747 flying from another time and place.</p>

<p>So there I am channeling Abramowitz Spencer Tracy Katharine Hepburn and Sidney Party Day.</p>

<p>And it was all great.</p>

<p>But it’s about the image of the airline.</p>

<p>So you are long on someone like Kirby’s United Airlines.</p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>The fact is USO has gone 90 to 20 and you now climb back up to 40.</p>

<p>Do you envision that you will yell and the others can get back to that market.</p>

<p>I have 90.</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>And the reason we say that is even if the earnings are what they forecast.</p>

<p>So back when we had our hundred dollar price target on United we were talking about them doing thirteen dollars in earnings in 2020.</p>

<p>And of course the pandemic interfered.</p>

<p>So we pushed that out to twenty twenty three or four.</p>

<p>But remember they issued shares during the pandemic to get through it.</p>

<p>And so when you add in the increase of the shares even if they get back to the net income no increase in shares outstanding means that you’re not getting back to the thirteen dollars.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re getting back to 12 and instead of nine multiple maybe as an eight multiple because the airlines are still losing money in a recession which if you recall that 2018 2019 timeframe people were saying oh the airlines will never lose money again and 2020 prove how wrong that that forecast was.</p>

<p>You know you’re dead on about you know Newark to Paris United Airlines.</p>

<p>Kirby’s got it on sale this week.</p>

<p>That was a nine thousand dollar ticket.</p>

<p>And I’m seeing a quote in October for four thousand six hundred eighty three.</p>

<p>That’s a while.</p>

<p>Change isn’t it.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Yes it is significantly lower.</p>

<p>And well no I get it.</p>

<p>October is not a time when a lot of people travel.</p>

<p>It’s more business time.</p>

<p>Yes it is.</p>

<p>But yeah I mean so it can settle.</p>

<p>So I’ll leave.</p>

<p>You’ll join us in Paris with Caylee in a surveillance road trip.</p>

<p>Tickets are on you Tom.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello Becker.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for planning the next surveillance junket.</p>

<p>As they say she is with Cohen and definitive on travel.</p>

<p>Good NIKKEI.</p>

<p>I’m sorry.</p>

<p>That’s gotta be good news from the shock of what we’ve been paying.</p>

<p>Yeah I think we’ve gotten a lot of good news maybe this week Tom and that it has been cooler inflation.</p>

<p>Good news is good news again for the equity market depending on how today NASDAQ.</p>

<p>One hundred could be up for a fourth straight week.</p>

<p>Well I’m not going to give my opinion here.</p>

<p>You know I could I could pop.</p>

<p>I mean Paul Sweeney wants me to do a fractional buy on the Friday opening but I don’t think I’ve got the courage to pull them.</p>

<p>I just want to attach to the cash like that attached to the Kailey Leinz.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support this week.</p>

<p>It’s been a really really valuable as well.</p>

<p>Futures advance up 21.</p>

<p>Stay with us.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>
