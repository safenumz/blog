<h1 id="fed-day">Fed Day</h1>

<p>We’re gonna see tightening through the back end of the year into the middle of next year and then quantitative tightening, QT continues in the background.</p>

<p>It’s unsustainable to have the Fed hiking rates at a very rapid rate doing QT with the economy slowing.</p>

<p>There is some thought that we’re getting to peak hawkishness but that’s not going to move the market.</p>

<p>Now the bigger risk than tail risk aspects are going to be really European energy crisis and how mid-term elections got this year.</p>

<p>Do you think the slowdown could be more significant.</p>

<p>Many economists are expecting this is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>It is Fed decision day Wednesday.</p>

<p>From New York City for our audience worldwide is not going to catch on is it.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>That’s more syllables.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance live on TV and radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Some Jonathan Ferro features RTX third of one percent.</p>

<p>We’re looking for another 75 basis point hike later on.</p>

<p>Market’s very dynamic in his decision this afternoon starts drawing a dominant constant here in a moment.</p>

<p>John affects markets says it all but I’m sorry I’m going to push it aside for the real yield.</p>

<p>Everyone out there noting that finally the real yield matters and I’ll get to Japan slides.</p>

<p>So straight off the top.</p>

<p>The 10 year bond Japan’s hasn’t traded for two days for the first time since nineteen ninety nine.</p>

<p>Before we get carried away with the Fed Reserve the bank giving to the S&amp;P tomorrow the bee the gone nowhere it seems.</p>

<p>Well Norah 143 99 yen and maybe it ought to be at a 1 5 to 45 but everybody’s afraid they’re going to act to make yen stronger.</p>

<p>What it really speaks to John is what’s shifted in the last few days.</p>

<p>And I’m sorry this will infect the press conference this afternoon.</p>

<p>It gives way more than the major peers here against dollar.</p>

<p>That’s got to get everyone’s attention at the press conference.</p>

<p>It’s got our attention already in a massive way.</p>

<p>At least the amount of work this Fed has done in such a small amount of time.</p>

<p>Fed funds has gone from the middle of March at about zero to six months later basically at 3 per cent a little bit later on.</p>

<p>What’s that done.</p>

<p>Hike in 75 basis points.</p>

<p>We went from the end of 2015 zero.</p>

<p>Three years later we got to 2.5 per cent of Fed funds.</p>

<p>Just think about how much it took last time over three years over three years to get there and this time about six months to do even more.</p>

<p>So are we there yet.</p>

<p>I mean I think that that’s the question.</p>

<p>People are looking for some kind of answer.</p>

<p>How high are they going to go.</p>

<p>What’s their dot plot.</p>

<p>People like to be looking at that even though inside a cringe and feel like this is a completely moving target and doesn’t give you any real information.</p>

<p>But nonetheless people will be targeting it and it’ll be guiding the markets post a Fed meeting.</p>

<p>But how much can we talk about a 4.5 percent Fed funds rate a four point seventy five percent Fed funds rate as we heard from Bob Michael Barr on your show yesterday with JP Morgan Asset Management.</p>

<p>What was fiery.</p>

<p>Yes he was 4.5 treasuries.</p>

<p>He’s talking up 750 basis point spreads.</p>

<p>And he’s basically saying wait for the recession have patients.</p>

<p>We’re not there yet.</p>

<p>Wait for until then.</p>

<p>Big cash position was interesting to me is he flicked at the divergence within his own team when it comes to credit when it comes to the fact that finally getting Yellen to times real yield point to the fact that you’re getting 8 percent on credit he’s having.</p>

<p>Just wait right to your point John.</p>

<p>It could go up to 12 percent because we have not been in a recession.</p>

<p>And this really shows how difficult this situation is for investors who really haven’t seen this scenario for decades.</p>

<p>He talked about generational divide within the bank.</p>

<p>He said to the people that lived the 1980s on the trading floor had a very different opinion about where this was heading compared to the natural bank coming out of the financial crisis.</p>

<p>John ISE strikes a bit.</p>

<p>Dog is strongly strongly agree that there’s a generational memory here that a lot of people don’t have.</p>

<p>It’s new territory for a huge percent of our viewers and listeners.</p>

<p>Let’s get into this market right now.</p>

<p>Futures up by about a third of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P 500 on the NASDAQ 100 up a tenth of 1 per.</p>

<p>So many messages this morning about Fed day performance over the last 18 months.</p>

<p>This from the Bloomberg team.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 index has risen after eight out of the last 10.</p>

<p>Decisions.</p>

<p>Lisa I think a lot of people are aware of that now.</p>

<p>And I wonder what that means for the Fed day performance today.</p>

<p>Yeah I wonder if people are going to look past this one to perhaps half a month a month after which tends to be quite different considering that people usually take two weeks to really understand what Fed Chair Jay Powell actually says because he usually has come out with hawkish proclamations and people don’t adjust until they realize oh wait they’re serious about it.</p>

<p>So we’re going to get something of the same today at 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Here’s what I’m watching.</p>

<p>Bank CEOs including Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Brian Moynihan of Bank of America as well as others are coming to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Financial Services Committee.</p>

<p>A lot of this will be trying to get some sound bites for different advertisements for different political candidates.</p>

<p>But how much do we get a real assessment of how much inflation is biting into the average consumer.</p>

<p>We are going to hear a lot of questions about inflation.</p>

<p>How much do we get a sense.</p>

<p>Yes of course the politicians are going to ask the banks what can you do about this.</p>

<p>But how much do they give a sense that really there is hurt that is spreading more rapidly than perhaps the real time or lagging data really as capturing today is there too at the U.N.</p>

<p>General Assembly.</p>

<p>I will not call it anger.</p>

<p>I really agree with you touched on and I actually was struggling with how many mistakes we were discussing anger and whether that’s an appropriate denomination just now.</p>

<p>You know I kind of agree.</p>

<p>President Biden is speaking at ten thirty five and he’s meeting with UK Prime Minister Liz Truss at what 15 PM.</p>

<p>What did you call it.</p>

<p>AC It’s going to be frosty.</p>

<p>Yeah it’s going to be.</p>

<p>There’s some I do.</p>

<p>I’m just suggesting it might Dani Burger.</p>

<p>They’re dealing with certain issues are having to deal with Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>And a couple of other issues and of course her plan that she’s unveiling isn’t necessarily ingratiating her with a lot of economists certainly locally in the United Kingdom as well as here in at 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>there is the FOMC rate decision.</p>

<p>I hear it’s FOMC rate decision on Wednesday followed by a press conference with Jay Powell.</p>

<p>Real yield.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>But the dollar dynamics are really telling.</p>

<p>And John we’re seeing the dollar strengthen to the most going back to 2002.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>This is a Europe story with the European situation getting a little bit worse at least in the perception of the IBEX market.</p>

<p>How much does this cause real disruption.</p>

<p>And I’m going to be focused on that.</p>

<p>What a shock.</p>

<p>Lisa thank you.</p>

<p>Appreciate it.</p>

<p>Joining us now just a fantastic lineup today and it will climax with former vice chair Rich Clarity a little bit late so we can kick things off with Dom Constant right now.</p>

<p>They had a macro strategy at Mizzou of America’s Dome.</p>

<p>At the epicenter of your work you’re expecting inflation to fall and fall so much more quickly than people expect.</p>

<p>Don why is that your position.</p>

<p>The main thing on the inflation side is that you have profit margins expanded through Covid and are still very very high which means all of the cost inflation has actually been passed through house prices and then prices have gone up even more because of that expansion.</p>

<p>And you can break it down in the GDP data and show that for 10 percent inflation about 4 percent or so is cost and about 6 percent is due to profits actually expanding.</p>

<p>So that actually means a soft landing is actually still likely because companies can sort of cut back on those profits and still bring down inflation without necessarily having to fire people as rapidly as you might otherwise think.</p>

<p>And what they end up doing is they end up tolerating very weak productivity relatively strong employment.</p>

<p>You can still get lower inflation and it’s a soft landing.</p>

<p>Ironically though it’s just a bit tougher to get inflation down.</p>

<p>You need to work on obviously tightening financial conditions and raising real interest rates where we are now.</p>

<p>If all central banks are exposed by definition what is their best their most efficient best policy.</p>

<p>Given the stochastic nature of up inflation and the sharp disinflation.</p>

<p>What’s their best practice right now.</p>

<p>I mean this is tough.</p>

<p>I mean it’s tough for me is partly in the US for example the housing market obviously a lot of people locked in interest rates you know.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>They’re not gonna be moving house but you know interest rate impacts on slowing spending when also there wasn’t very much equity extraction in the first place.</p>

<p>Just makes it all very tough.</p>

<p>I think it’ll take time.</p>

<p>I think time is probably what you need.</p>

<p>And the Fed is finally only just really moving through the neutral rate now and getting restrictive.</p>

<p>So I think the message from the Fed is policy rates and real rates.</p>

<p>Yes those are the things they need to get up but they have to keep them there which is kind of the message.</p>

<p>So it’s not really a story about zooming them up aggressively and then reversing.</p>

<p>It’s more story about getting to a steady level of restriction and just being patient and trying to convince people that they’re taking the medicine for their own good and things will at some point normalize.</p>

<p>Just how lonely do you feel in your soft landing car right now.</p>

<p>Very good actually.</p>

<p>I mean it’s soft landing.</p>

<p>Doesn’t mean the Fed doesn’t have to raise rates and doesn’t have to maintain rates.</p>

<p>And the curve could stay very inverted for a while.</p>

<p>What it means is that the employment losses if you like are somewhat capped as inflation comes down.</p>

<p>And so you might well see unemployment rise to 4.5 5 maybe in 5 5 percent.</p>

<p>But in the end inflation really ought to come down quite a lot.</p>

<p>It doesn’t mean you have to take unemployment significantly higher and unravel everything that kind of was achieved in the post Covid period.</p>

<p>Dani Burger.</p>

<p>I was just wondering how much pushback you’re getting and whether you think that a hard landing whatever that means maybe higher unemployment maybe negative GDP growth whether that’s baked into equities and then you should go a long risk because you have a more optimistic view than the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Well I think I mean I think the the hard landing story kind of links to you know very deep losses in real GDP and obviously a very sharp increase in the unemployment rate and a kind of collapse in profits.</p>

<p>So the soft landing still gives you a very weak GDP maybe not as weak.</p>

<p>I mean you could be bumbling along zeros and small negatives.</p>

<p>You just don’t get the big increase in unemployment.</p>

<p>You just get the very bad productivity growth in the back of it and profit margins on the main thing they come in.</p>

<p>But I just look at operating earnings and say look if if in the peak they might have been over 200 they’re going to trend is like 180.</p>

<p>They come down towards trend but a hard landing that come much lower.</p>

<p>So it’s not great news for equities but it’s not a complete disaster.</p>

<p>So that’s the way I’d put it.</p>

<p>And and financial conditions you know are going to stay tight for a while.</p>

<p>So it’s gonna be a bit frustrating.</p>

<p>So there are nuances to the differences between hard and soft.</p>

<p>Thank you for joining us today.</p>

<p>Customer at Mizzou of America’s brand.</p>

<p>I mentioned that Chairman Powers addressing the news conference won’t stand anything like what we just heard in the last five minutes.</p>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>He’s going to talk about the need to get it rates higher that they’re not that close.</p>

<p>They’re going to keep going perhaps halfway there perhaps less than halfway there depending on whether J.P.</p>

<p>Morgan Asset Management or perhaps more than halfway.</p>

<p>If you’re taking a look at some of the pushback that they’re going to hard he’s going to have to come out and be hawkish.</p>

<p>Otherwise massive undermining and credibility and bearish on the economy potentially.</p>

<p>Chairman Power talked about the pain talked about the pain in that Jackson Hole speech time.</p>

<p>I went back over it last night.</p>

<p>And in that paragraph those couple of sentences where he talked sentences we talked about pain.</p>

<p>I just wonder if it’s captured by the forecast today because in a previous round of forecasts it wasn’t really it’ll never look at the forecast.</p>

<p>You know John I don’t believe in the dark plot this time.</p>

<p>It matters.</p>

<p>I make an exception for Allison.</p>

<p>Michael McKee will break that down.</p>

<p>It really matters a lot.</p>

<p>It.</p>

<p>Are you going to be looking at the dark like Tom.</p>

<p>No the case will not be looking at the dark.</p>

<p>That doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>I consider a.</p>

<p>Mistake but John the forecast today really matter.</p>

<p>I’m proud of it.</p>

<p>Thank you just for opening the summit.</p>

<p>Can I just tell you you’re so on on UNGA.</p>

<p>It’s disgrace.</p>

<p>And it reminds me of the Blue Swede redo of B.J.</p>

<p>Thomas hooked on a feeling 30 50 years ago where they open up Hugo.</p>

<p>You know what you do when you talk about a complex that accompanies that team mate that band.</p>

<p>I’m not going to go Chuck go.</p>

<p>You really not believe that I’m even a it inside of me.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Is a disgrace.</p>

<p>It’s the United Nations general as well said some.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>So what.</p>

<p>I suggest that I take charge.</p>

<p>Good to have you back.</p>

<p>Features up two tents from Haiti.</p>

<p>OK this is pulling back.</p>

<p>Tom Keene Mack in full force keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin declares it a fight to the death with the U.S.</p>

<p>and its allies.</p>

<p>He is calling up three hundred thousand reserve troops in a major escalation of the war in Ukraine who also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>He said that the U.S.</p>

<p>and its allies want to destroy Russia.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian counter offensive in the last few weeks has dealt Russian troops their worst defeats since the early months of the conflict.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates today to the highest level since 2008 and it’s likely to forecast that there will be further increases for the third straight meeting.</p>

<p>Policymakers are expected to raise rates by 75 basis points.</p>

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to stress the Fed’s resolve to curb inflation.</p>

<p>That’s near a 40 year high.</p>

<p>The Bank of Japan is trying to cap upward pressure on yields before a policy decision later this week.</p>

<p>The central bank announced an unscheduled bond buying operation.</p>

<p>The OJ governor Rico Kuroda has emphasized his determination to maintain rock bottom interest rates even though many other developed nations are increasing them.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Liz Truss reportedly will cut the rates of stamp duty for home purchases.</p>

<p>That’s according to the Times of London.</p>

<p>The newspaper says stress will announce a measure Friday as part of a budget to stimulate the UK economy.</p>

<p>Therefore they don’t change the nature of the conflict.</p>

<p>This will only further worsen the situation.</p>

<p>Therefore we need to provide more support for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Jens Stoltenberg the NATO Secretary-General with Bloomberg’s Annmarie Horden from New York City this morning.</p>

<p>Good morning Tom Keene.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro counting down to a Fed decision with equity futures just about positive up a quarter of one per cent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq up a tenth of 1 percent.</p>

<p>Yields coming back from multi-year highs on a 10 year DAX basis points 353 77 a dollar stronger euro dollar some negative a half of 1 per cent 99 25 as the Russian leader mobilizes even more troops.</p>

<p>Years ago I was on the bottom of a hotel in Chicago with Gloria Laureate Thomas showing the giant of game theory and war.</p>

<p>And one of the six people here simply said the doctor Schelling.</p>

<p>How two wars in nowhere like this morning does this matter with us.</p>

<p>Annmarie Horden here in the game theory of Vladimir Putin you have a wonderful history here based out of London of studying Russia.</p>

<p>You went to Vladivostok on my right down there and a few others long ago.</p>

<p>How do you respond as a journalist to these threats of nuclear war from Mr.</p>

<p>Putin.</p>

<p>Well I think he’s just upping the ante yet once again.</p>

<p>I mean we’ve seen him do this already before this threat of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>But clearly he is making this move as he sees Ukrainian forces make inroads in Ukraine.</p>

<p>They went from they were able to capture.</p>

<p>I mean we’re talking about the size of Delaware Rhode Island level of Kiev.</p>

<p>Now he is going to have these sham referendums in Donetsk Rouhani.</p>

<p>This is the Donbass region.</p>

<p>He said he always wanted to have and then her side and zapped region that will connect him to Crimea.</p>

<p>And by doing that he is calling up reservists.</p>

<p>And this is how he’s making a play to the Russian people.</p>

<p>And at the same time telling the West I am prepared to take it to that threat level that would make everyone incredibly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Every single military expert I have spoken to says it’s just a threat.</p>

<p>He would never do anything short term medium term long term nuclear issues.</p>

<p>I’m not an expert on it.</p>

<p>Every single guest says it’s unthinkable.</p>

<p>But we’ve had we’ve been at that spot before haven’t we.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>And he’s done the unthinkable.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Not everyone also thought including President Lansky that he would even make inroads into Ukraine the way he did.</p>

<p>What I would say is and this is on background from someone who really understands the Russian apparatus had told me that the reason why he does not think Putin would ever go for the button on nuclear weapons is because he is not sure if his military would carry it out.</p>

<p>And at that point his reign would be over.</p>

<p>Anne-Marie a lot of people are talking about the European response the potential United States response to put up the potential for there to be for example jets sent over to Ukraine as a possible response to an escalation by Russia.</p>

<p>How united have people seemed in your discussions at the U.N.</p>

<p>General Assembly Council.</p>

<p>Well at this moment they’re incredibly united.</p>

<p>And what else can you say.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Putin is having sham referendums.</p>

<p>And then at the same point he’s telling all of the West to be on guard.</p>

<p>Do not call my bluff.</p>

<p>Those were his words last night.</p>

<p>So what you have is the United States the NATO secretary general all of these countries all of shots all of these leaders especially on the bilat having bilat this week alongside the U.N.</p>

<p>General Assembly having an An.</p>

<p>And this gives it almost a new impetus to have that fresh unity that for all of this week going into this meeting the big question was whether or not they’re able to remain united going into the winter.</p>

<p>This almost forces their hand to make sure they can make that case to their own economies and societies.</p>

<p>I’m looking right now at natural gas prices that ticked higher on the back of this news.</p>

<p>You see Brent crude ticking higher on the back of this news.</p>

<p>What’s the case for why that is really happening given that a lot of the bad news has already been accounted for and priced in.</p>

<p>Well just more geopolitical risk if there’s a if there’s a nuclear war on the markets.</p>

<p>Obviously this is something the markets are watching.</p>

<p>They thought potentially at some point there could be peace negotiations especially when you had Ukraine making up some of this territory in a very successful counter-offensive.</p>

<p>So this is just going to add to the geopolitical risk.</p>

<p>Also we need to really unwrap what is going to happen this winter in Europe and what we’re hearing right now.</p>

<p>Overnight Germany has taken unipolar.</p>

<p>They nationalized it.</p>

<p>I spoke to the Qatar foreign minister yesterday.</p>

<p>Schultz will be in Doha on Sunday.</p>

<p>They are still trying to make sure they have enough natural gas to get them through this winter.</p>

<p>And obviously the following in the following winter.</p>

<p>I am just thinking about the president’s address a little bit later this morning.</p>

<p>Do you expect him to address some of these issues.</p>

<p>Hundred.</p>

<p>The president is really going to make his speech about something we’ve heard him talk about before democracy’s verse autocracies and he’s gonna talk about the quote naked aggression.</p>

<p>According to his national security adviser Jake Sullivan briefing reporters yesterday in terms of what Russia is doing in Ukraine.</p>

<p>And here’s something else the president is set to do.</p>

<p>He’s set to talk about the principles that work for all countries and that pushes back against aggressors who seek to threaten course and intimidate their neighbors or to violently attack them.</p>

<p>He’s likely going to call out Russia which is on the Security Council which makes you question can the U.N.</p>

<p>really do anything.</p>

<p>It’s a very good point.</p>

<p>Annmarie Horden here in D.C.</p>

<p>and I thank you for the U.N.</p>

<p>General Assembly.</p>

<p>This tweet just came at some moments ago from Horseshoe laughs on Twitter.</p>

<p>I agree with your detest of the UNGA acronym.</p>

<p>Yeah the doctrine to call mature institutions by their proper name.</p>

<p>So you’re going to stop calling Tom Keene CAC now.</p>

<p>Oh no no.</p>

<p>You can call me NIKKEI John Micklethwait.</p>

<p>You are mature but to say this is a sure thing.</p>

<p>My mother called me T Kirk so I frankly loved it when I hear T.K..</p>

<p>My mother called me T.K.</p>

<p>My father called me you John.</p>

<p>Team coverage in London.</p>

<p>It was very important that all of us were steeled for what went on with the show drama of the funeral the mourning of a weakened line.</p>

<p>And you know frankly I had to drill deeper into the culture of London.</p>

<p>And so I migrated north Annmarie Horden helping me out here on the move up.</p>

<p>And oh my word it was team coverage from London.</p>

<p>That was your view.</p>

<p>That was my view.</p>

<p>Larry King.</p>

<p>This is a John explained the majesty of Mr Sun coming in and scoring three goals in like 13 minutes.</p>

<p>That’s how you get a player team to fight.</p>

<p>You put them on the bench and then you bring him off the bench.</p>

<p>NIKKEI summit affair.</p>

<p>Even he had something to prove and those first two goals in that hat trick.</p>

<p>So we’re just absolutely awesome.</p>

<p>Can you describe the moment Tom your first English Premier League.</p>

<p>I loved it.</p>

<p>I teared up except every bartender and cigar bar.</p>

<p>I went to their Arsenal fans.</p>

<p>I don’t I don’t understand why a game to go to some 6 2.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Complain about low scoring games and you got 6 2 game is your debut appearance.</p>

<p>Yeah it was fascinating to see.</p>

<p>I saw the VAR in action which I still don’t understand.</p>

<p>I saw penalty shortstop that was taken back and on and on.</p>

<p>But what I really saw were the British people.</p>

<p>It was it was stunning.</p>

<p>John Micklethwait when they sing God Save the King.</p>

<p>It was just like to go on say it.</p>

<p>Best sport in the world.</p>

<p>Best board in the world.</p>

<p>Thank you Tom.</p>

<p>Mr Leavy I really like the actor just absolute after me not the world.</p>

<p>A song Paul Allen.</p>

<p>No I’m on board.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Go Spurs.</p>

<p>Thank you Spurs.</p>

<p>Thank you Arsenal.</p>

<p>Now he’s going to start back at the top with the Spurs.</p>

<p>Life from New York City this morning gets more and it gets the price action on this fat decision day features positive by quarter of 1 percent on the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>You’re all familiar with the statistics of the Fed day decision price action blend that breaking them down for you in the last 10 Fed decisions eight of them.</p>

<p>This market has rallied and you’ve seen some big moves so far this year.</p>

<p>I got to push back against that view this time around.</p>

<p>The NASDAQ positive by just a tenth of 1 percent in the bond market massive changes at the front end and a yield curve on Taylor Riggs right now.</p>

<p>395 25 came very very close to 4 percent in yesterday’s session.</p>

<p>We started the year at about 76 basis points twelve months ago.</p>

<p>The 2 year was at 21 basis points.</p>

<p>We even started the month at about 349.</p>

<p>We just keep adding more and more weight to the front end to the curve.</p>

<p>It’s been the theme so far of the year the 10 year old side.</p>

<p>I think this is the eighth consecutive week the yields have been climbing 350 377 on a 10 year.</p>

<p>Yields come in just a couple of basis points.</p>

<p>It hasn’t just been the United States though.</p>

<p>Well let’s take a global snapshot.</p>

<p>What’s happened to the global bond market and look at core government bonds exclusively.</p>

<p>We can take a look at a 10 year Treasury bond 300 basis points year to date a 10 year bond.</p>

<p>Remember on a 10 year bond we started the year in negative territory.</p>

<p>We’re now plus 200 basis points to about 188.</p>

<p>And some you’ll notice something that sticks out like a bit of a sore thumb for the.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Oh this is barely a 10 year change ATP because they’ve kept that thing capped Tom at around 25 for radio right now.</p>

<p>This is three point five.</p>

<p>Germany one point nine.</p>

<p>Japan zero point three.</p>

<p>And John it really speaks to the impossibility Japan is in its state.</p>

<p>Can they keep setting this out.</p>

<p>Can I keep saying this out as the pressure continues to build and we’ve been exploring this in the last week or so.</p>

<p>What would happen if the BMJ abandoned that yield curve control story to the rest of that bond market bought.</p>

<p>It’s just it’s just it’s got to be played out through its foreign exchange and you’re seeing it.</p>

<p>And what has happened here folks in the last two or three days is again yen has not gone 144 45 right now.</p>

<p>Tougher Yvonne Man 143 90 stabilizing in the 1 40s.</p>

<p>Tom is probably not what they are.</p>

<p>How can fall through the rest of this year.</p>

<p>Very good.</p>

<p>We will continue here right now and with the Federal Reserve coverage today and look for us this afternoon we’re really ready for this was Michael McKee of course in the press conference.</p>

<p>Peter Hooper joins us now to say he’s global head of economic research at Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>Barely describes his contribution to economics and how he and David focus land led in research in this crisis.</p>

<p>I’m going to state.</p>

<p>I may be wrong on this.</p>

<p>They discuss recession first.</p>

<p>Dr.</p>

<p>Hooper thank you so much for joining us today.</p>

<p>I want to go to the Deutsche Bank reach and particularly the work of Michael Spencer in Tokyo and the Pacific Rim that you people have done for decades and decades.</p>

<p>And I just wonder simply when I look at E.M.</p>

<p>currency give way on this day of the Federal Reserve for Chairman Powell is he going to be overcome by events.</p>

<p>Chairman Powell is got one mission that to do with inflation certainly is putting pressure on other countries but strong dollar is adding to inflation pressures just about anywhere you look at this point.</p>

<p>But that’s not going to deflect.</p>

<p>Chair Powell on his mission.</p>

<p>We’re going to hear a hawkish message today.</p>

<p>Probably going to drive the dollar further.</p>

<p>Is it a hawkish message towards neutrality or are we at an even general equilibrium.</p>

<p>And today do we become restrictive.</p>

<p>Now 75 basis points today is not going to put us in restricted territory given where inflation inflation is.</p>

<p>Given how tight the labor market is.</p>

<p>My my colleague Matt was there.</p>

<p>He did a great piece last week indicating why we need to get close to 5 percent.</p>

<p>You have to add not just the inflation picture but but the tightness of the labor market that Howard has been talking about as being central to this inflation problem.</p>

<p>I mean labor market we’ve seen the NAIRU running above 5 percent in the five and minutes given given all the various indicators you look at the tightness of the labor market we’re just way beyond the norm on a lot of different metrics not least of which is where look where wage wage inflation is now.</p>

<p>Peter that call from Matt last week we’ll read that piece close to 5 percent on Fed funds.</p>

<p>Let’s stick into that.</p>

<p>The pushback that I got when I put out that research on behalf of you guys and a lot of people sent messages to Lisa to my staff to Tom and basically said how on earth can we live with four and half nevermind five.</p>

<p>What does the economy look like with five percent Fed funds.</p>

<p>The economy is going into recession here.</p>

<p>We’re not expecting it tells the middle of next year perhaps a little sooner but that’s part of the way you’re going to have to ease up on this labor market in order to ease up the labor market.</p>

<p>You can’t bring down vacancies by themselves.</p>

<p>Historically it’s never happened.</p>

<p>You’re going to have to see the unemployment rate go up.</p>

<p>It’s going to have to get above 5 percent in order to deal with inflation with the inflation problem we have here.</p>

<p>So you know financial conditions have not been helping out until until we get to the reversal in the CPI for the August numbers.</p>

<p>But we have further to go.</p>

<p>And the Fed is going to have to push harder.</p>

<p>It’s going to have to get up into a restrictive range which we think is certainly a 4 percent plus for right now.</p>

<p>Peter it sounds like Deutsche Bank has been getting more bearish generally on the global economy as well as how far central banks will have to go.</p>

<p>Earlier this morning at your bank put out an estimate for European GDP revising it downward to negative two point two percent for next year from zero point three percent of a decline basically a deeper recession in Europe.</p>

<p>Have you had the same kind of revision to the U.S.</p>

<p>view based on how far the Fed has to go to stymie inflation from here.</p>

<p>Well so in Europe the European hit hit not just by the inflation problem and tightening by the ECB but obviously the cut off of Nord Stream wine has had a major impact.</p>

<p>We revised our growth rate for Germany down from 1 minus 1 percent to minus 4 percent next year.</p>

<p>Mark Wall our chief economist for Europe as you say put out a very nice piece this morning indicating the spillover from Germany and the rest of Europe being somewhat affected by the gas cutoff is enough to certainly put us in recession.</p>

<p>Now that that is a modest negative for the U.S.</p>

<p>but it’s certainly not enough to put Powell off course at this point that the inflation problem is going to be there.</p>

<p>It’s going to continue in this tight labor market continues until we see some some real slowdown in the U.S..</p>

<p>Peter I guess I’m trying to gauge the depth of the recession that you see in the United States.</p>

<p>You do say a 5 percent in a real neutral interest rate.</p>

<p>You also are looking at unemployment 4 above 5 percent.</p>

<p>You’ve a sense of the duration not only of how long rates will stay there but also of how long we will be in a negative growth higher unemployment kind of environment.</p>

<p>Well we expect growth has slowed noticeably in the first half next year.</p>

<p>I mean part of what’s happening here is we’ve seen this rotation of spending from goods where production was ginned up substantially.</p>

<p>Now that’s shifting over to services.</p>

<p>Inventories are running up.</p>

<p>We’re going to have to see some inventory adjustment first half next year which will certainly begin to slow things down.</p>

<p>Then we think that this war chest of savings that the households is supporting the households will begin to run down enough for consumer spending to begin to begin to slow by the middle of next year.</p>

<p>We’re anticipating negative growth for the second half next year minus three and a half percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.</p>

<p>Another negative not quite as deep in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>And then beginning to come back in 24.</p>

<p>So it’s a relatively moderate relatively brief recession.</p>

<p>The Fed begins to reverse course on its rates because it because that slowdown is going to help bring inflation down and allow it to reverse course.</p>

<p>Something that’s not in its current forecast at this point.</p>

<p>Peter is the recession spread evenly across America.</p>

<p>Does a certain part of the public face the Deutsche Bank recession call and others can escape its grasp.</p>

<p>Well it’s is always a way if you will.</p>

<p>I mean there are a wide wide range of income distribution and certainly lower income households.</p>

<p>We’re gonna be hit harder.</p>

<p>We’ll be hit more on the job front.</p>

<p>That’s the unfortunate part of this.</p>

<p>But I think given the recession is going to be consumer driven that will tend to be more broadly based than something that initially a big housing crunch.</p>

<p>But yes this will be a broad based recession.</p>

<p>It’s not going to hit all some big kills in that paid a fantastic way to work the rate work at Deutsche Bank over the last few weeks in fact for most of this year.</p>

<p>Peter Hooper the Deutsche Bank Securities Tom that call on narrowband somewhere close to stunning 5 per cent.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>I wonder where the Fed is on that and what it means for their unemployment projections that ultimately need to factor in higher unemployment get inflation lower if he believes it’s close to 5.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of work to be done.</p>

<p>Not then they reject of another time and place.</p>

<p>And I argue and all you need to know is the first two letters are not accelerating.</p>

<p>It’s the quiet point is calculated with some unobservable data points.</p>

<p>It’s something people enjoy flunking on economic exams.</p>

<p>But it’s the quiet point you have to get to to get the slowdown done.</p>

<p>And to have it above 5 percent is something a huge body of people have never experience.</p>

<p>I wonder whether at least they’re forecasting because you ran the Fed’s got unemployment three point seven twenty three three point nine.</p>

<p>They’re going to 24 a four point one.</p>

<p>They don’t have the luxury of young you Lazare of UCLA and Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>They’ve got a spin a message if you will.</p>

<p>This is true of every single institution.</p>

<p>Folks have got to spin a message that’s appropriate and gradual with Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>There’s a suddenness to it.</p>

<p>And those forecasts are set to be updated later a little bit later this afternoon.</p>

<p>I want to see what they are.</p>

<p>I especially want to understand how high they expect to have to go because of the resilience in the economy.</p>

<p>And every different analyst who I’ve spoken to has said that right now this economy has been able to withstand higher rates better than so many people had expected because companies had termed out debt because individuals hadn’t taken on as much debt because people had locked in fixed rate mortgages.</p>

<p>All of these things that make it a less easy transmission of monetary policy forcing the Fed to go further.</p>

<p>How are they going to recognize that and how that’s going to put forced their hand with a lag effect that we can’t really see right now.</p>

<p>They are the two major questions right now.</p>

<p>How much higher rates need to be to bring down growth and how much slower growth needs to be to break down inflation.</p>

<p>That’s going to be a key feature in a conversation around the Federal Reserve a little bit later and a key feature of our conversation with the former vice chair Richard Florida.</p>

<p>Joining us straight after the Fed decision.</p>

<p>And then he’s gonna stick around for the news conference which I just think is incredibly cool.</p>

<p>It’s gonna catch up with us after the news conference with Chairman Pound and break what he thinks down ISE a gallon on some.</p>

<p>It’s going to be fast.</p>

<p>And what an honor to have him here.</p>

<p>He’s the academic from Columbia with massive monetary shock.</p>

<p>First question for me John has to know.</p>

<p>Are they making it up as they go.</p>

<p>You will get the first question of two tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>Live from New York this is pulling back.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin is threatening to escalate the war in Ukraine even further.</p>

<p>Putin is calling up hundred thousand reserve troops and vowed to use all means necessary to defend Russian territory.</p>

<p>He also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Kremlin is moving swiftly to annex parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces.</p>

<p>The feds ready today to hike again and to send a hawkish message for the third meeting in a row.</p>

<p>Policymakers are expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points.</p>

<p>That would bring rates to the highest levels since 2008.</p>

<p>Chair Jerome Powell is likely to hammer home that he believes further rate hikes are needed to tame inflation.</p>

<p>European Central Bank President Christine Legarde says borrowing costs will rise more in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Speaking in Frankfurt Lagarde said the ECB has taken major steps to tackle inflation and she expects to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings.</p>

<p>The special master in the Donald Trump documents case is skeptical of some of the former president’s arguments.</p>

<p>Federal Judge Raymond Dearie pushed back on the Trump lawyers position that they didn’t need to detail any alleged declassification of highly sensitive records.</p>

<p>He said the Justice Department had presented evidence that several of the documents were classified.</p>

<p>Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Mateo.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>We saw such high increases due to speculation over the geopolitical situation and some of the other issues that we’re now seeing a kind of backing off of that.</p>

<p>I mean I think one hundred and twenty barrels 120 dollars a barrel was too high for the supply demand situation.</p>

<p>And so we’re seeing that back up.</p>

<p>But into catch up with Anna Edwards senior fellow at the Atlantic Council a lot from New York this is Bloomberg counting it down to a Fed decision with equity futures just about positive up a third of one per cent call it that quarter of 1 per cent on S&amp;P up a tenth of 1 per cent on the NASDAQ 100 yields lower by a couple of basis points 353 77 euro weaker euro dollar negative a half of 1 percent to 99 26.</p>

<p>I can tell you the Swedish currency is getting absolutely battered again for a fifth straight session.</p>

<p>Weaker against the U.S.</p>

<p>dollar.</p>

<p>Might sound leftfield but just give me a second.</p>

<p>Some the BRICS bank count yesterday with a 100 basis point blank and we’re still getting currency weakness.</p>

<p>City Tanaka’s of City published just moments ago and he said a continuation of the sell off in risk assets due to the eurozone.</p>

<p>Strong economic headwinds and the Fed’s tightening path will maintain significant pressure on both the Norwegian currency and the Swedish currency as well against the dollar.</p>

<p>And many of these central banks Tom they share the same concern at the moment.</p>

<p>It’s going to be the bank having this turn tomorrow hiking into a slowdown and struggling to get any traction in the affects market.</p>

<p>You have to look the paper up Joan.</p>

<p>It’s a good 25 years old a brilliant paper from I believe the Peterson Institute.</p>

<p>And John it’s about watching 30 and 40 currency pairs at once.</p>

<p>That’s a little hard to do.</p>

<p>But there is a value to looking at Nike Starkey or a dollar Swede and the rest.</p>

<p>I mean you’ve got to look at all these pairs dynamically.</p>

<p>Do you have a guesstimate of where we’re going.</p>

<p>There’s a similar experience at the moment some against the U.S.</p>

<p>dollar that’s for sure.</p>

<p>And sending the Federal Reserve is not their problem.</p>

<p>Yes everybody else.</p>

<p>I just wondered some for how much longer that might be the case.</p>

<p>For those of you unfamiliar DAX.</p>

<p>Why is the core an ancient index.</p>

<p>Bloomberg Dollar Index is better math one ten point five seven and D X Y is a shock and particularly a shock to the nations of commodities.</p>

<p>CONOR Hick joins us now head of research at EDF Man in his just brilliant on the soft something we don’t talk enough about.</p>

<p>CONOR the impact of a strong dollar on commodity nations commodity.</p>

<p>E.M.</p>

<p>how large is it.</p>

<p>Huge huge I mean if you think about only six months ago when the war began in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Everything went up whether it was energy grains.</p>

<p>They all went up.</p>

<p>And that was because it’s highly inflationary then inflation may start in the US mid to high end U.S.</p>

<p>dollar.</p>

<p>That U.S.</p>

<p>dollar then caused that whole commodity elevation to just come collapsing down.</p>

<p>And now we’re back to pre-war levels.</p>

<p>So you had a dollar impact on commodities a very intact and reinvest and invest correlations as intact as ever.</p>

<p>My training used to always pivot to Indonesia and Brazil on dollar strength.</p>

<p>Are they of interest.</p>

<p>Well yes Indonesia will save palm oil massive producer oil exporter and coal is low until Brazil.</p>

<p>I mean take it from a soft commodities.</p>

<p>You cannot underestimate the impact of the Brazilian drought on all of these commodities.</p>

<p>So what we’re seeing today is the strong dollar is causing to be around to weaken.</p>

<p>That in turn is putting pressure on things like coffee sugar soy beans all the major Brazilian exports iron ore even.</p>

<p>But it’s not just that.</p>

<p>I mean I think today commodities are reacting.</p>

<p>They were positive initially because of the inflation story.</p>

<p>But now they’re coming off because the inflation story has moved to a recessionary story.</p>

<p>And obviously that’s not great for commodities.</p>

<p>Worse for metals and energy arguably less so for soft.</p>

<p>But it still it still isn’t.</p>

<p>It does have a dampening effect.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>The focus so very much on the energy story especially for Europe as they face off with a potentially catastrophic winter depending on the meteorologists reports that we get.</p>

<p>I’m wondering from your perspective if the answer is what Germany is now doing which is to nationalize energy companies does that help support things any more concrete way or does it just basically put a Band-Aid over the actual bill at some of these countries are facing.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>So I think in my opinion it’s a Band-Aid because the reality is that none of this is providing additional supply.</p>

<p>So we have a supply demand mismatch right now and the energy crisis.</p>

<p>So we either take our demand.</p>

<p>So you have to ration demand.</p>

<p>And I can’t see Germany effectively rationing the demand.</p>

<p>And suddenly in the UK they’re actually subsidizing the demand.</p>

<p>That doesn’t even talk about some things on the supply side.</p>

<p>I’m thinking I don’t see them investing or allowing more natural gas to come out.</p>

<p>So I don’t see this as fundamentally altering the situation too much.</p>

<p>And I think this this can go on for a while with us.</p>

<p>When you say this can go on for a while there is a question of how much has already been priced in in terms of what is to come for this winter.</p>

<p>And then there is a question as John’s highlighted many times of the duration of how long how many years we face off with this lack of supply in the face of demand.</p>

<p>What’s your view on both of those.</p>

<p>So with time you know humans are very negative and markets are adaptive.</p>

<p>So with time what’s going to happen is as long as prices continue to provide this pain pressure you will stop seeking adaptation.</p>

<p>So you will move towards alternatives when your body will become more efficient.</p>

<p>So that’s definitely what will happen with time overnight.</p>

<p>You’re not gonna get that.</p>

<p>So I think it’s fake to me.</p>

<p>What you are saying is we need that pain pressure to continue for a little bit.</p>

<p>You want more turf to materialize these kind of actions.</p>

<p>Only then when we start seeing a proper diversification both in terms of demand and also supply so we can stop relying less on natural gas relying less on Russia and even rely less on Ellen.</p>

<p>GM understanding that the LNG carriers on the streets are going through the roof.</p>

<p>They’re struggling to get hold of ships.</p>

<p>So it’s a multitude of problems are not going to be fixed overnight.</p>

<p>This is going to take a while kind of hack that of 80 and F man.</p>

<p>Thank you CONOR as always.</p>

<p>Several winces maybe Lisa perhaps even longer.</p>

<p>And for many officials in Europe I think that’s the reality they’ve got to confront.</p>

<p>The problem is is that each nation has its own energy situation its own energy crisis.</p>

<p>It’s completely different.</p>

<p>So how do they come up with a cohesive plan especially when you have such differing political interests heading into this winter.</p>

<p>It’s really complicated.</p>

<p>You’re seeing that expressed to the euro.</p>

<p>But a homebase for me I know have birth funding UK situation.</p>

<p>Fascinating.</p>

<p>Time to see what this new prime minister’s got to take in the UK and this new chancellor as well.</p>

<p>That punish some very interesting things.</p>

<p>A lot of people are worried about housing prices at the moment and they’re now looking at cutting a transaction tax when you buy a house term.</p>

<p>So let’s see what happens there.</p>

<p>They seem little and there’s sort of sprinkling them out of course off the shock of the death of the queen and a new king and a new government as well.</p>

<p>But John a pregnant question here.</p>

<p>Does she have the support of her party to shift the support of the country till.</p>

<p>That’s the big question.</p>

<p>I think she’s got the support of her party right now and the party membership.</p>

<p>If that went to a general election would she get the mandate to do the kind of things that this party is going to do to let the coming months.</p>

<p>Let’s frame it as we did with Peter Hooper in decline.</p>

<p>This is not year to date but very close.</p>

<p>I took it from the peak year in January or February.</p>

<p>ADX way down a good amount.</p>

<p>JP Morgan Emerging Market Index down is well they’re done 8 or 9 percent.</p>

<p>And then John there’s the emerging market of the United Kingdom down I believe 17 percent.</p>

<p>Having a very difficult time yet today.</p>

<p>That’s for sure.</p>

<p>Futures positive let’s call it a quarter of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P on the NASDAQ up a tenth of 1 percent.</p>

<p>A Federal Reserve decision just around the corner.</p>

<p>And they’re set to hike interest rates again by 75 basis points.</p>

<p>From New York.</p>

<p>This is pulling back.</p>

<p>We’re going to see tightening through the back end of the year into the middle of next year and then quantitative tightening Kuti continues in the background.</p>

<p>It’s unsustainable to have the Fed hiking rates at a very rapid rate.</p>

<p>We’re doing duty with the economy slowing.</p>

<p>There is some thought that we’re getting to peak hawkishness but that’s not going to move the market.</p>

<p>Now the bigger risk than tail risk aspects are going to be really European energy crisis and how mid-term elections does this year.</p>

<p>Do you think the slowdown could be more significant.</p>

<p>Many economists are expecting this is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>One more big rate hike just around a corner perhaps even more than that.</p>

<p>A life from New York City for our audience worldwide.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Jonathan Ferro features positive a quarter of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P T.K..</p>

<p>The consensus view another 75.</p>

<p>Coming right up.</p>

<p>There it is.</p>

<p>And then what will happen after that.</p>

<p>And as Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank told us this is just neutrality.</p>

<p>This is not a restrictive Wednesday.</p>

<p>You may get that in the last two meetings of the year.</p>

<p>But I think John all agree that even with this move today we’re nowhere near finished and then we get the forecast.</p>

<p>Will they forecast the risk of a hard landing in the U.S.</p>

<p>economy.</p>

<p>No they will forecast in a measured gradual way.</p>

<p>They’re a public institution and they’re number one they’ll never say it.</p>

<p>But the number one goal is to control the message and not instill fear.</p>

<p>They’re not going to go to the fear that we see from so many houses.</p>

<p>Elisa the chairman talked about that pain in his Jackson Hole speech.</p>

<p>He talked about pain that might have to develop to get inflation back down.</p>

<p>Will they capture some of that pain in that summary of economic projections.</p>

<p>That’s going to be something people are looking for for the credibility of the Federal Reserve not just for the United States.</p>

<p>I’m curious if they reflect the pain being felt around the world how they’re gauging the international influence on the United States when they start to care about the dollar.</p>

<p>They’re probably not going to talk about that but that has to be a niggling point on the outskirts of Jay Palace mind considering some of the pushback they’ve gotten for the likes the World Bank and the IMF.</p>

<p>Bank of England tomorrow Swiss National Bank.</p>

<p>Tomorrow they have a convening as well.</p>

<p>At the moment Lisa tough spots for them.</p>

<p>Those three and maybe more so for departure.</p>

<p>How about this for signaling they actually engaged in an unannounced bond purchasing program overnight to support the yield peg where it is.</p>

<p>You haven’t a trading in Japanese bonds for two days.</p>

<p>The first time has happened going back to 1999.</p>

<p>It is not a market.</p>

<p>They are doubling down.</p>

<p>And it’s sort of surprising to me the yen hasn’t given away to new weakness bottoms.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>We were talking about this earlier.</p>

<p>He said people are scared to go against the Bank of Japan to go against Japan and Japanese resolve to keep things where they are and potentially up and everything if they change that.</p>

<p>But right now wow what an outlier and what a ticking time bomb that really is.</p>

<p>Staff to date him to two days to the Japanese 10 year government.</p>

<p>Bond has not traded for two days to translate this for non sophisticates.</p>

<p>They are doing a theory.</p>

<p>It’s no different than China’s doing with Covid.</p>

<p>They’ve got a theory but there’s no published background.</p>

<p>Richard Clare and John and all of the studies in Illinois under his excellence at Columbia never has read a paper that shows that theory can work on market central planning.</p>

<p>Let’s see how it works out.</p>

<p>Futures positive a quarter of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>She will Carnegie dance with fat decision.</p>

<p>With futures on the Nasdaq up by almost a tenth of 1 per cent yield to lower by couple of basis points to 353 97.</p>

<p>That has not been the trend.</p>

<p>It’s been your attire your attire your time on a two year lease.</p>

<p>So we came very close to 4 percent.</p>

<p>People really expecting a lot from this meeting but also beyond.</p>

<p>And that is the reason why the dot plot might matter to some people why it could move markets significantly at a time when people want to understand is this Federal Reserve moving close to the Deutsche Bank projection a potentially close to 5 percent neutral rates or end rates for the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>bank CEOs including Jamie Diamond of J.P.</p>

<p>Morgan and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America are heading to the hill there and be testifying before the House Financial Services Committee.</p>

<p>A lot of theater.</p>

<p>Curious to hear what they say about inflation how it’s affecting consumers consumer lending.</p>

<p>Are they getting more restrictive in how often they are lending considering the fact that potentially people are going to have a harder time paying it back in the face of higher prices for basic day to day costs.</p>

<p>Today is day two at the U.N.</p>

<p>General Assembly.</p>

<p>Traffic is sufficiently.</p>

<p>It completely clogged up in New York City.</p>

<p>President Biden will be speaking at ten thirty a.m.</p>

<p>and then he is going to be meeting with UK Prime Minister Liz Truss at 115 PM.</p>

<p>Here is to hear how that meeting goes.</p>

<p>Not just because of some of the tensions with respect to Northern Ireland as well as U.S.</p>

<p>Britain.</p>

<p>British trade policies but also this pushback about some of her fiscal policies.</p>

<p>Does he address what she’s doing.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of coherence with the U.S.</p>

<p>support of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Heading into also a potentially difficult winter at 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>this is the main event the FOMC rate decision followed by a press conference by Fed Chair Jay Powell.</p>

<p>A lot of questions.</p>

<p>You were talking about John whether he’s going to acknowledge some of the weakness that may be required according to some people if we get inflation down or for getting inflation down.</p>

<p>I’m watching the dollar.</p>

<p>We’re looking at a dollar that is the strongest going back to 2002.</p>

<p>Yes this is a euro story.</p>

<p>Yes this is a British story.</p>

<p>But this is also very much a Federal Reserve story.</p>

<p>When do they start to care about this is not a positive in reducing imported inflation but a negative John.</p>

<p>Because what it does to the rest of the world will eventually rebound in some form on U.S.</p>

<p>corporations as well as just generally the U.S.</p>

<p>economy.</p>

<p>I’ve been enjoying the steady traffic report when you continue that.</p>

<p>Do you want that.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>I mean if we really keep going down the track.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>You said you have you know definitely barriers on the road.</p>

<p>There are barriers.</p>

<p>Dump trucks tumble.</p>

<p>John I got out.</p>

<p>I got out.</p>

<p>But when you let me out eight blocks away from our office here in midtown and the police stopped me.</p>

<p>And of course I had a tantrum.</p>

<p>I said do you know where I’m at.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Did.</p>

<p>They put me in a police car drove me out to the George Washington Bridge who said Walk.</p>

<p>See you later.</p>

<p>See.</p>

<p>Do you know who you know who I am.</p>

<p>That’s such a t CAC doesn’t burn up by the George Washington Bridge.</p>

<p>It’s beautiful.</p>

<p>On the way to New Jersey.</p>

<p>Tom Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Yeah it’s about to walk back to our office here as a if you look at Englewood Cliffs.</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>I was like over there.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about the Dow alone.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>Oh my God.</p>

<p>You know they to what they do.</p>

<p>Yeah I’ve heard they talk about it a lot on that side of the bridge.</p>

<p>I’ve got no idea why futures are up on the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>But by T 10 measures up.</p>

<p>I mean Larry Hines joins us now global CIO for Street State Street Global Advisors.</p>

<p>Larry 75 expected today.</p>

<p>That’s what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>Can you guide us to November.</p>

<p>Do you expect to get that done.</p>

<p>It’s today.</p>

<p>Well it’s going to be hard to define what November brings because the Fed continues to be really focused on the emerging data.</p>

<p>So I think that they’re going to keep their cards close to their best.</p>

<p>We think that 75 today is almost a certainty.</p>

<p>And we actually do think that 50 is more likely for the balance of the year.</p>

<p>But the problem is that as long as they keep seeing this intractable inflation pressure for the data they will be compelled to act more decisively.</p>

<p>Larry where do I hide.</p>

<p>I mean stays true to such a fabulous institution on sector analysis factor analysis diversifying into subsets and what not to do.</p>

<p>Where do I hide if I’m worried about what not to do right here.</p>

<p>Well the best place is cash and for the first time in many many years.</p>

<p>Cash is actually giving you a bit of a return.</p>

<p>So in our globally diversified portfolios we’ve actually taken that cash position to about 10 percent.</p>

<p>And interestingly we’re not just taking it out of the equities we’re actually taking out of bonds as well.</p>

<p>So we’re a bit more balanced in where we’re underweight.</p>

<p>Laurie can we develop that a little bit more.</p>

<p>Which bonds are you talking about.</p>

<p>Duration 10 year 30 year Treasury yields.</p>

<p>Because you see those yields even going higher from here.</p>

<p>Or are you talking corporate credit in the face of some sort of downturn.</p>

<p>Yeah actually much more focused on corporate credit and being a bit underweight there.</p>

<p>We’re sort of neutral duration curiously enough but it’s a bit more barbell.</p>

<p>So cash plus long duration because we actually are concerned that we will have a much more aggressive fed and that will create a much more contractionary than recessionary environment.</p>

<p>That again is not our core call but work conditions that we have a little bit of optionality if we’re a little bit off on that Larry away from your room.</p>

<p>But let me go there to the income statement.</p>

<p>Are there dynamics or control blocks down the income statement earnings or free cash flow.</p>

<p>Or is this really about a diminished revenue story.</p>

<p>Well at this point in time we don’t feel like corporations are necessarily under pressure.</p>

<p>They’ve got relatively large caches of cash.</p>

<p>They actually are navigating the inflationary environment pretty well in terms of being able to pass on some increases to consumers being able to reconfigure their operating models and things of that nature.</p>

<p>So we’re in oh by the way in the high yield indices especially we could actually be on the verge of some upgrades because we had a lot of downgrades as we headed Jacobus.</p>

<p>So they’re actually the fundamentals there are not particularly prickly.</p>

<p>The problem is until we know what terminal rates are on the Fed Plaza it’s hard to know how to discount those future cash flows.</p>

<p>It’s the equity market.</p>

<p>Until then just totally unbearable.</p>

<p>The reason I ask this Larry is it just seems to me every time we rally get a host of people to say this is not the Fed not what the Fed wants.</p>

<p>They want financial conditions to remain tie in with cap to the Fed purchase.</p>

<p>Now a Fed Co.</p>

<p>Now when does that change.</p>

<p>Well curiously not but I was a little surprised to see this as well.</p>

<p>We’ve actually seen net inflows into equities.</p>

<p>So you still have had people dipping in buying the dips.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s some of it’s rebalancing because of course equities and bonds have been down but actually equities have been down more.</p>

<p>But it’s also a little bit of this fear of missing out again because what we all know is that at some point markets become a leading indicators of future economic growth.</p>

<p>And so if we do have a recession or a contraction at some point we get past that.</p>

<p>So it’s still a very unsettled market in the range of outcomes is quite large.</p>

<p>Larry I know that a stay straight.</p>

<p>Larry one of the best.</p>

<p>Thanks for being with us.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>At least that’s the problem a lot of people have with this market.</p>

<p>Remember David Kostin of Goldman Sachs coming into the summer who’s basically just said we’ll be kept it through the summer.</p>

<p>The Fed’s told you the playbook.</p>

<p>They want tight financial conditions.</p>

<p>That means an equity market account running too much.</p>

<p>I hear that Neel Kashkari has been watching that very closely.</p>

<p>Nina basically set the climate to outlast didn’t he.</p>

<p>On the did not.</p>

<p>Yes I was in town.</p>

<p>And Tracy Alloway basically said look we actually would be happy to see stocks sell off a little bit more.</p>

<p>Well we get the same kind of message from Jay Powell today.</p>

<p>Does he comment on financial conditions accurately reflecting or perhaps not reflecting as much.</p>

<p>What they’re hoping to achieve.</p>

<p>Could I just suggest as a fossil that if you get rates back to where they are and has not seen Taleb said brilliantly in the last number of days you know what we’ve been living is physics with our gravity and we’re finally back to gravity some form of risk free rate.</p>

<p>John can I suggest life goes on like you know rates go up then.</p>

<p>Pete spin in trust.</p>

<p>I’m with you.</p>

<p>We talked about adapting and adjusting yesterday.</p>

<p>Did you just because you went hey so we thought we’d bring it up.</p>

<p>You know there were so many world leaders lined up at Gatwick I couldn’t get down with it.</p>

<p>And I just think yeah got to get going.</p>

<p>I’m not a big fan of Gatwick.</p>

<p>I’m not either.</p>

<p>The drive was Amanda Lang Gatwick.</p>

<p>I had three cars with me.</p>

<p>It never had fits.</p>

<p>It took a month to Kate’s account with the surveillance.</p>

<p>Wondered who then goes up.</p>

<p>Sun goes down.</p>

<p>Companies adapt.</p>

<p>Wilson’s going to talk about that.</p>

<p>Yes sir.</p>

<p>It’s going to start in a justice sketch in a May delay.</p>

<p>The interview is going to join us in 50 minutes now from New York.</p>

<p>This is pulling back.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin declares it a fight to the death with the U.S.</p>

<p>and its allies.</p>

<p>He is calling up 300 thousand reserve troops in a major escalation of the war in Ukraine who also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>He said that the U.S.</p>

<p>and its allies want to destroy Russia.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian counter offensive in the last few weeks has dealt Russian troops their worst defeat since the early months of the conflict.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates today to the highest level since 2008 and it’s likely to forecast that there will be another increase.</p>

<p>Now for the third straight meeting policymakers are expected to raise rates by 75 basis points.</p>

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to stress the Fed’s resolve to curb inflation.</p>

<p>That’s near a 40 year high.</p>

<p>The Bank of Japan is trying to cap upward pressure on yields before policy decision later this week.</p>

<p>The central bank announced an unscheduled bond buying operation DOJ.</p>

<p>Governor how did he go.</p>

<p>Kuroda has emphasized his determination to maintain rock bottom interest rates even though many other developed nations are increasing them.</p>

<p>It’s the latest foreign takeover of a British tech company.</p>

<p>France’s Schneider Electric has agreed to buy out minority shareholders in industrial software company Aviva Group.</p>

<p>It’s a deal that values VEBA at ten point eight billion dollars.</p>

<p>Schneider already owns 59 percent of the VEBA global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than 20 700 journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Howard policy regarding China on Taiwan has not changed.</p>

<p>We adhere to the one China policy.</p>

<p>Having said that we are concerned about China’s stated ambitions course of behavior.</p>

<p>There is no reason to threaten Taiwan in the way that China does.</p>

<p>Fantastic conversation with Jens Stoltenberg the NATO secretary general and Olympics Amari Hotel and life from New York City on this fact decision day with some key and Lisa Abramowicz some Jonathan Ferro features are positive.</p>

<p>Two tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq basically unchanged.</p>

<p>Now yields come down about 2 basis points 354 36 got a stronger much much stronger in G10 euro dollar negative five or six tenths of one per percent just about holding on to 99 not some euro dollar.</p>

<p>Ninety nine sixteen euro weakness this morning off the back of some strong words from the Russian leader.</p>

<p>Yeah your weakness.</p>

<p>Really critical.</p>

<p>Lisa pick this up.</p>

<p>I missed it to be blunt.</p>

<p>Point 9 9 1 6.</p>

<p>Anything under point nine nines a huge deal and we are there.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to monitor that again.</p>

<p>The vic’s 27 showing 24 to 27 in the last number of days.</p>

<p>Tension.</p>

<p>We will continue now on Russia and on their leader.</p>

<p>Annmarie Horden joins us here as we just simply rip up the script.</p>

<p>And I do so.</p>

<p>Anne-Marie in February announcing my Book of the year which was Angela Stent Putin’s World.</p>

<p>With all that’s going on here how would you judge how what I’m gonna to call the hard right of Russia or the center of Russia or what I’d call the liberal left of Russia.</p>

<p>How do they adapt to the comments of the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>I mean they get in line.</p>

<p>What happens when you don’t.</p>

<p>Yes Russia does have domestic politics.</p>

<p>You see that.</p>

<p>Whether it’s the Communist Party in the Duma which John and Lisa and I spoke about yesterday they’re the ones that came up in February and said we should recognize as separate entities Luhansk and Donetsk.</p>

<p>And then Putin went in announces a special military operation.</p>

<p>It was also the head of the Communist Party that said we should now be calling this a war.</p>

<p>After that counteroffensive that may have led Putin to want to actually make these moves because now he could put reservists on the ground in these territories if he sells to the Russian people that the these are legal Russian territory as the reservists.</p>

<p>I mean maybe it’s an unfair question to you but in your reporting well they also have contractors.</p>

<p>I know what a reservist is in Tulsa Oklahoma.</p>

<p>What’s a reservist in the euro mountains.</p>

<p>It’s individuals that joined the Russian military that are not being used right now.</p>

<p>You have to remember that Russia is also using a lot of contractors in this war and they’re not going for a full fledged conscription but they are calling up 300000 mature.</p>

<p>Count them as reserves.</p>

<p>This is putting the backs up of Russian everyday Russian individuals domestically.</p>

<p>This is going to be a bit more challenging for Putin.</p>

<p>Emery is there any coincidence or any overlap with the fact that Xi Jinping just met with Vladimir Putin and now this move of possibly calling up some of its reservists.</p>

<p>It’s the first thing email I woke up to this morning from a viewer who said Putin making this move after he just met with Xi Jinping.</p>

<p>And remember it was earlier this year that these two leaders said that their friendship has quote unquote no limits.</p>

<p>What do we have also this morning.</p>

<p>You have a seminar a military seminar.</p>

<p>Xi Jinping is telling that seminar to focus on preparing for war.</p>

<p>You also have Kyodo newspaper saying that at the party Congress next month which is this is an incredibly critical for a Xi Jinping that he is going to talk about his plan for reunification with Taiwan.</p>

<p>Now potentially these two items were discussed amongst each other because Putin doesn’t have a lot of friends right now.</p>

<p>He has Beijing.</p>

<p>He’s getting some ammunition from North Korea and the Iranians.</p>

<p>That’s really yet when it comes to pure potential friends at this moment.</p>

<p>What’s the U.S.</p>

<p>doing in response to Xi Jinping I mean this is coming at a pretty fraught moment on multiple levels.</p>

<p>Well Jake Sullivan the president’s national security adviser yesterday said that the U.S.</p>

<p>has one.</p>

<p>China policy has not changed.</p>

<p>But we heard for the fourth time from the president yet again to go a little bit more off script when it comes to Taiwan.</p>

<p>And that 60 Minutes interview really astonishing what he said not so much that they would just send warplanes and military.</p>

<p>He was asked unlike Ukraine would you send U.S.</p>

<p>personnel military men and women.</p>

<p>And he answered yes.</p>

<p>It couldn’t be more direct.</p>

<p>Amari thank you AMH.</p>

<p>Here in New York City for the U.N.</p>

<p>General Assembly Tom Reuters reporting that this morning I heard you squeeze in UNGA Reuters reporting early this morning.</p>

<p>You thought that was going to slide.</p>

<p>Come on.</p>

<p>I am.</p>

<p>How did you get to the box before we get completely derailed.</p>

<p>Just report from Reuters this morning that one way flights Tom san and gout after this announcement.</p>

<p>One way flights from Russia.</p>

<p>So direct flights from Moscow to Istanbul in Turkey to Armenia as well destinations where Russians can enter without a visa.</p>

<p>They’re sending out some of the back of this.</p>

<p>It’s very fluid and our news flow.</p>

<p>And that’s why I’m looking at more and more of the European journalists coverage that we’re seeing from Bloomberg and from other sources as well.</p>

<p>Jonas.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest John I just think it’s simply off the American radar slammed in this morning obviously but it bears almost careful scrutiny.</p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p>Is that an escalation.</p>

<p>Lisa.</p>

<p>I think part of the markets e treating it as such as such an escalation.</p>

<p>The euro weaker off the back of some of this.</p>

<p>We saw the haven flow in the early part of the European session.</p>

<p>Is Vladimir Putin doubling down.</p>

<p>Right now it’s raising questions about what else he could do.</p>

<p>It does also though raise this issue.</p>

<p>And Anne-Marie is touched on this very well which is popular support of this.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>It’s different when you have to actually go to war versus sit there and sort of hear the propaganda in terms of what the war is accomplishing.</p>

<p>I wonder how much the popularity or some of the issues they’re in are affecting some of the job owning both when it comes to Russia as well as China.</p>

<p>Just based on the fact they’re heading into a people’s Congress meeting that is coming at a pretty fraught time.</p>

<p>Also politically and from a social perspective due to the lockdowns readjusting our growth expectations lower.</p>

<p>I saw your note from Deutsche Bank earlier this morning.</p>

<p>Now we’re getting real about what a recession in the eurozone at least is going to look like.</p>

<p>Yeah it was pretty depressing.</p>

<p>I got to be honest.</p>

<p>And the bar is pretty high for me to get depressed but it really was depressing to see them downgrade their forecast for growth from negative zero point three percent negative two point two percent and saying that there is potential for further downside because of the potential for a really cold winter.</p>

<p>How much does this really get affected one way or another if there is an escalation does that really affect the gas supplies.</p>

<p>Because a lot of people are just discounting them altogether.</p>

<p>Can we just compare and contrast that with the ECB own forecasts for 2023.</p>

<p>What’s the growth there at positive zero point nine per cent for 2023.</p>

<p>And Tom you’ve got Deutsche Bank saying it’s going to be negative 2.</p>

<p>Yeah 2 and precedent.</p>

<p>The guard was asked a lot about this in a news conference.</p>

<p>Where’s the recession in the forecast.</p>

<p>You said it wasn’t in the base case.</p>

<p>Should it be in the base case.</p>

<p>Because Italian or most people for most people right now it is the base case for Europe.</p>

<p>We’re moving in real time.</p>

<p>And as we talk about these trends things like neutrality and know John the lift up in German yields is a different quality of lift up than America because of their more tepid nominal GDP and their lack of technology as an economy piece and leaving behind the negative interest rate era and moving on some with much much higher yields in Europe and beyond features positive two tenths on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq 100 basically unchanged on this Fed decision day yields lower by 2 basis points.</p>

<p>Your 10 year 353 ninety seven.</p>

<p>Is this a buy for Mike Collins and a team at PJM.</p>

<p>We’ll ask him next.</p>

<p>Life in New York City this morning.</p>

<p>Good morning on this decision day.</p>

<p>Here is your equity market just about positive by a little more than a tenth of 1 percent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq negative zero point zero three percent.</p>

<p>You know the numbers.</p>

<p>I’ll talk about them again if the last 10 Fed decisions on eight of them.</p>

<p>This market has rallied.</p>

<p>Can this market rally if Chairman Pound brings out the Jackson Hole speech once more and just read it verbatim once again we’ve got word today as bond markets done a ton of work already.</p>

<p>Twelve months ago we were at twenty one basis points on a two year.</p>

<p>Right now three point ninety six per cent yields come in by about a half a basis point on a 10 year down 2 basis points to 354 36.</p>

<p>A big change though over the last two months.</p>

<p>Your tie your tie yields so much higher in the U.S.</p>

<p>and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Let’s pick out a place where yields are not so much higher this year.</p>

<p>Let’s look at Japan.</p>

<p>Look at what’s happened with the bond market and look about happened with the currency.</p>

<p>Or rather I should rephrase that.</p>

<p>Look at what hasn’t happened with the bond market and look at what has happened with the currency you know to Betty climb this year relative to what we’ve seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>They’ve kept them pinned lower caps trying to sit on them.</p>

<p>A tenure in Japan at about 25 26 basis points and look at what’s happening with the currency.</p>

<p>Because of that some we’ve had a 25 percent move on dollar yet.</p>

<p>That’s a monster movie.</p>

<p>Let’s stay on that for Bloomberg Radio folks 144 17 is a huge deal on year and it’s finally giving way to a weaker yen just in the last 10 minutes ago.</p>

<p>So John and you know you look where the level is 145 146 a dialogue changes Tom.</p>

<p>Even the central banks that have moved they’re still struggling.</p>

<p>Look at Sterling 113.</p>

<p>Look at the Swedish currency.</p>

<p>Even with the wrecks bank delivering a 100 basis point hike against the dollar right now Tom is a tough tough go to get some kind of traction in the effects market even if you are hiking if you’re doing what the Bank of Japan is not doing.</p>

<p>Sterling intraday low.</p>

<p>John 113 5 11 12 is essentially unimaginable except for there right now.</p>

<p>Jack can I mentioned in our travels of the last three days for all of us we have finally broken through on the index that matters the Bloomberg total return United States aggregate index something in all the bonds.</p>

<p>Lisa knows this better than me.</p>

<p>Guess what you do low price in the index through the June low.</p>

<p>A difficult moment I think late tonight both looking forward to the conversation with Mike Collins and page him to see if this difficult moment is a big buying opportunity.</p>

<p>That’s across asset price action.</p>

<p>Want to get to a single name with you.</p>

<p>We can do that now with Lisa.</p>

<p>Hey Lisa.</p>

<p>Hey John.</p>

<p>So you know Tom’s been talking a lot about companies adapting and adjusting and how they do really deal with the situation that they’re dealt with.</p>

<p>And there are three stories today that really highlight to me how they are doing this.</p>

<p>And that is cutting jobs and cutting jobs at a corporate level.</p>

<p>Take a look at Gap.</p>

<p>Their shares are dramatically underperforming.</p>

<p>The broader market down 48 percent so far year to date.</p>

<p>Just announced that it’s cutting 500 corporate jobs in San Francisco New York in Asia.</p>

<p>This comes after their partnership with the former Canyon West fell apart.</p>

<p>It comes as a Ford downgraded some of their forecasts in August.</p>

<p>How much does this really tell a story for retail.</p>

<p>How much is this idiosyncratic.</p>

<p>Then take a look at Boeing.</p>

<p>This is a manufacturer of big planes.</p>

<p>They just said they’re going to outsource some of their finance and accounting jobs to India.</p>

<p>Their shares are lower by almost by more than 27 percent so far year to date.</p>

<p>It shows how people are trying to reduce costs in different creative ways perhaps cutting jobs perhaps outsourcing.</p>

<p>Not exactly the jobs that they used to outsource.</p>

<p>They still are hiring some engineers locally.</p>

<p>Just sort of shows the shifting winds and encompass the housing market.</p>

<p>A company that really depends on online sales has been absolutely decimated this year.</p>

<p>Those shares down more than 70 percent so far year to date.</p>

<p>The CEO coming out and saying that it was going to be cutting more jobs particularly in the technology sphere and that there’s more to come.</p>

<p>There’s some losses associated with this.</p>

<p>Again Tom you’ve been talking about adopting and adapting and adjusting.</p>

<p>That’s going to lead to the pain that we’re hearing from Fed Chair Jay Powell.</p>

<p>But where’s the 30 year mortgage here in like a week or two of six point two percent goes out Lisa to the gap.</p>

<p>And I think this is really important is one of the ideas here that’s new with a risk free rate is we finally these zombie d zombie fi zombie companies do they finally go out of existence after a 12 13 year gift which it’s full circle.</p>

<p>Back to your point about corporate credit.</p>

<p>Have we fully accounted for some of that pain in that market considering the fact that there has been the repricing that you pointed to but potentially there could be more to come.</p>

<p>Very good.</p>

<p>We will continue right now on this on corporate credit with Michael Collins senior portfolio manager of PJM Fixed Income.</p>

<p>Michael what I notice here and I understand the messiness of it let’s forget that yield up.</p>

<p>We all know that Chairman Powell deal that today but in many cases praise very.</p>

<p>Very very down.</p>

<p>And we’re seeing in the Bloomberg total return aggregate index the old Lehman Barclays indices as well.</p>

<p>What is the significance of new low price.</p>

<p>Are those aggregate indices.</p>

<p>Yeah Tom is as you point out has really been nowhere to hide this year in fixed income I mean and in our shop we’ve got three big things right.</p>

<p>We’ve kind of stepped aside on a duration meaning taking our our long positions down to neutral.</p>

<p>We’ve taken credit risk way down.</p>

<p>We’ve generally been a little long the dollar but that has not been enough to protect investors from that big trend down in prices.</p>

<p>The good news is as you know when bond prices are down below par with which they all are really for the first time I can think of in my career Tom we’re seeing the bonds across the board across all of our portfolios trading at big discounts to par.</p>

<p>And as you know as long as they don’t default.</p>

<p>As Lisa pointed out they end up back at par.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>So you actually had this really positive long time opportunity in fixed income which we haven’t had for for well over a decade.</p>

<p>Michael I look at the mantra of the real yield the whole professional study of the inflation adjusted yield.</p>

<p>Explain to mere mortals why the real yield matters.</p>

<p>Yeah I mean that is the world’s discount rate right.</p>

<p>I mean I’m always surprised when when people say wow I can’t believe stocks and bonds are both selling off at the same time this year.</p>

<p>And I tell them as well you just wait until you see real estate and private debt and other assets that that haven’t sold off because they’re not actively traded.</p>

<p>They’re not mark to market every day.</p>

<p>Wait for those shoes to drop because when the discount rate the world’s discount rate which is really real treasury yields by and large goes up as much as it has as much as you know a couple hundred basis points.</p>

<p>All asset prices have to come down.</p>

<p>And the question really is have they come down enough at this point.</p>

<p>Well let’s get into that right now Mike.</p>

<p>We caught up with our good friend Bob Michael Barr of J.P.</p>

<p>Morgan Asset Management yesterday.</p>

<p>I asked him about high yield.</p>

<p>He said not yet.</p>

<p>Patience spreads need to get somewhere close to 750 basis points.</p>

<p>That Treasuries need to get somewhere close to 4.5.</p>

<p>The Fed funds could push 5 percent.</p>

<p>Any of that resonate with you right now Mike.</p>

<p>Would you take the other side of that trade.</p>

<p>Yeah you know I’ll take a little bit of the other side on the rate thing.</p>

<p>I think we’re much closer on the rate side.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Our view is that the rates are going to crest and come down first and then credit spreads and equities will will continue to widen and sell off before they settle down.</p>

<p>But I think we’re really getting close to a point Jonathan where the likelihood of the Fed and most other central banks overshooting significantly on the upside and having to reverse course.</p>

<p>I know the whole concept of the pivot you know was in vogue a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>And now people are pushing that aside.</p>

<p>And wow as they keep pushing these rates up at the same time that global growth you know risk is coming down.</p>

<p>Earnings are coming down.</p>

<p>As Lisa points out the faults are probably going to go off.</p>

<p>Geopolitical risk continues to to elevate.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>And inflation globally is really kind of rolling over.</p>

<p>And I think it’s going to be probably a lot lower in a year from now.</p>

<p>Just as all of those things are happening these central banks are jacking up rates ad nauseum.</p>

<p>And I think that’s a real recipe for a big reverse course on the rate side on the credit side.</p>

<p>I think you’re right.</p>

<p>I mean earnings we’ve done a lot of work on earnings expectations going forward.</p>

<p>And I think they’re going to keep coming down.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>And people don’t talk enough about the dollar and the impact on that for U.S.</p>

<p>companies for their competitiveness further repaid Patriot earnings.</p>

<p>The labor costs continue to put pressure on margins.</p>

<p>And as Lisa pointed out you know you’re starting to see layoffs finally happen.</p>

<p>So I think there’s a little more downside in credit before.</p>

<p>Before you jump in with both feet.</p>

<p>This is all really mess here.</p>

<p>Michael I wonder just to put it all together quickly if you could give us a sense of how you play this the conviction behind buying certain discounted bonds taking the other side above Michael but also acknowledging what you see coming.</p>

<p>Yeah I mean you stick with you stick with higher quality credit right and presumably that’s what a big active shop with 140 panelists.</p>

<p>Liza Right.</p>

<p>And that’s really our bread and butter.</p>

<p>And this is an opportunity in the market where where everything is kind of sold off right in unison just to some extent.</p>

<p>And there are real lot of relative value opportunities.</p>

<p>You can buy really high quality credits at really big yields really big spreads low dollar prices.</p>

<p>So there is a lot of opportunity there without taking a lot of credit risk.</p>

<p>And we’ve taken our credit is down.</p>

<p>But the yields that we’re seeing across the board in the bonds we own the high quality bonds we own the portfolios we manage are really big.</p>

<p>So I mean you don’t have to take a lot of credit risk.</p>

<p>Ultimately you’ll want to do that dip down and credit it but it’s definitely too early.</p>

<p>Just so I think like for the rest of the day and get it right.</p>

<p>If you’ve been down this 10 year 350 Mike.</p>

<p>Yeah we we we haven’t yet.</p>

<p>We’re we’re we’re dead neutral here.</p>

<p>Jonathan then.</p>

<p>But but again that is going to be the the big the first trade really out of the gates here.</p>

<p>And maybe you have to wait for for today.</p>

<p>The Fed is going to probably sound pretty hawkish today even though they’ve done a good job on Fed days.</p>

<p>I know we’ve talked about this on the program before.</p>

<p>Typically the days the Fed meets in the days Jerome Powell speaks that the equity markets tend to go up.</p>

<p>So they do a good job of getting investors off the ledge a little bit.</p>

<p>But but you know those that dot plot is going to be ugly.</p>

<p>I think a lot of it’s probably priced in and the markets are braced for it.</p>

<p>But there will be an opportunity I would bet the next couple of quarters to really start getting long duration.</p>

<p>We’ll catch up and talk about it.</p>

<p>My comments that a feature.</p>

<p>Thank you Mike.</p>

<p>Now’s not the time Tom.</p>

<p>But he did give you a sequence of events a sequence of what he would buy and when and why he’d find them before others have trouble with the sequence.</p>

<p>I thought it was really intelligent from Mike Collins.</p>

<p>But what was the sequence of events twelve months ago.</p>

<p>Things like Treasury’s first because it’s gonna get hammered.</p>

<p>This Fed will have to back away but a more straightforward folio.</p>

<p>Sent us out with a note to a 60 40 tonne this year.</p>

<p>Not nice teachers.</p>

<p>It’s a triple average cash a quarter of 4 percent.</p>

<p>If I take cave outperformed everyone this year.</p>

<p>Congrats.</p>

<p>The Chancellor called me back.</p>

<p>Can you run a portfolio at the Treasury.</p>

<p>Somebody suffers all cash.</p>

<p>Sterling.</p>

<p>Oh yes.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Well that’s a really important point.</p>

<p>You had you know from New York this is pulling back.</p>

<p>Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin is threatening to escalate the war in Ukraine even further.</p>

<p>Putin is calling up three hundred thousand reserve troops and vowed to use all means necessary to defend Russian territory.</p>

<p>He also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Kremlin is moving swiftly to annex parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces.</p>

<p>The feds ready today to hike again and to send a hawkish message for the third policy meeting in a row.</p>

<p>Policymakers are expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points.</p>

<p>That would bring rates to the highest level since 2008.</p>

<p>Chair Jerome Powell is likely to hammer home that he believes further rate hikes are needed to tame inflation.</p>

<p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says borrowing costs will rise more in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Speaking in Frankfurt Lagarde said the ECB has taken major steps to tackle inflation and she expects to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings.</p>

<p>China says it has the patience to bring someday bring Taiwan under its control.</p>

<p>Now a government official said that what he calls Taiwan compatriots realize the future is in unification.</p>

<p>That contrasts with polling in Taiwan showing skeptical views for Beijing.</p>

<p>Beyond Meat has suspended Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey.</p>

<p>He was arrested on charges that he beat a man’s nose during a fight after a college football game in Arkansas.</p>

<p>It’s another blow for the plant based protein company which cut its revenue forecast last month.</p>

<p>Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>I thought that I would never get to 4 percent but I’ve changed that view.</p>

<p>They certainly will.</p>

<p>And probably by the end of this year I think they’re going to have to go higher at the beginning of next year.</p>

<p>But then I think they’ll pause.</p>

<p>I also think they’ll slow down their rate hikes the further they get away from the neutral rate.</p>

<p>I was making Green the global chief economist of the Con Institute.</p>

<p>Many people share that view.</p>

<p>That’s the change for the consensus view in the last three months or so.</p>

<p>Most people now looking for that forehand on this market price for something close to 4.5.</p>

<p>The Fed decides in several days time life from NATO.</p>

<p>OK this is Bloomberg Surveillance equities up by a third of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq 100 up by a little more than a tenth of 1 percent yield to labor by 3 basis points on a 10 year 350 358 good effect decision statement of course a news conference with Chairman Powell and some forecasts and a dot plot in the mix as well.</p>

<p>We do.</p>

<p>It’s going to be absolutely fascinating because we’re thrilled.</p>

<p>The former vice chairman Richard Clarke will join us here in a number of hours as well.</p>

<p>Vincent Reinhart he’s chief economist at Dreyfus in Melbourne.</p>

<p>But on this historic day for Central Bank Mr Clare Dr Clare would suggest that Mr Reinhart is a must listen.</p>

<p>Vincent Reinhart invented modern research in Washington at the Fed for Alan Greenspan and has a terrific perspective on forecasts.</p>

<p>Maybe not dot plots.</p>

<p>We won’t blame him for that.</p>

<p>Vince thank you so much for joining today.</p>

<p>I went back and I did a Google search of the Fed blinks and there’s any number of days where this is part of the Zeit Geist.</p>

<p>When does the central bank blink.</p>

<p>When do they stop a theory to go the other way.</p>

<p>When the policy choice gets harder right now.</p>

<p>Here’s the bad news.</p>

<p>This is the easy part of central banking because they are so far away from their inflation goal.</p>

<p>Jay Powell wakes up in the morning and says inflation is too high.</p>

<p>He worries as he goes to bed at night.</p>

<p>C inflation is still too high.</p>

<p>Policy choices raise rates.</p>

<p>It will get harder when you have to top out where you raise rates right.</p>

<p>Inflation is closer to goal and the unemployment rate is rising.</p>

<p>This the end date managers I said of a certain vintage Vince that we’re sort of used to higher interest rates like an actual risk free rate.</p>

<p>We’ve all been there before.</p>

<p>Does the media and the Zeit Geist of Wall Street do they overplay the world’s coming to an end.</p>

<p>Given a march to neutrality just about every time don’t they.</p>

<p>The fact is that there are long cycles in rates.</p>

<p>We’ve been here before.</p>

<p>The Fed goes through tightening any tight tightening spells and easing spells and.</p>

<p>Pauses and we’re just tightening spell.</p>

<p>It is going to have to last longer.</p>

<p>That’s a consequence of being slow out of the starting gate.</p>

<p>You’ll have to go higher.</p>

<p>That’s a consequence of being slow at the starting gate.</p>

<p>But this time next year we’ll be talking about what how long will the Fed be pausing.</p>

<p>And so we were just speaking with Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank who sees neighbor who or the neutral that the end rate for Fed funds rates to be at near 5 percent possibly exceeding that.</p>

<p>We’re hearing more people call for a greater likelihood of that kind of pain that kind of rate backdrop for a prolonged period of time.</p>

<p>Do you agree.</p>

<p>Yes I think Terry Powell agrees with Peter as well.</p>

<p>Remember at the last press conference chair Powell pointed to the estimates for natural rate and said that his committee’s his own view was higher.</p>

<p>Well generally when the chair is saying his own view is higher it tells you the committee is going up.</p>

<p>So I would expect that the summary of economic projections will see a higher natural rate.</p>

<p>And importantly they have to go above their natural rate in order to create some slack that slows inflation.</p>

<p>So the base is rising and the overage relative to that base is falling higher given they started late.</p>

<p>Vincent what do you expect the unemployment rate to be in those projections.</p>

<p>How much of a downside how much more of a potential recession case do you see starting to leak out in some of this forward look from the Fed today.</p>

<p>Well the part to worry about is central banks were always incremental.</p>

<p>They always don’t weigh out all the bad news.</p>

<p>So I would expect the unemployment rate to go up.</p>

<p>I would expect less of an immaculate decline.</p>

<p>Inflation as has been the case more than a simple summary of economic projections but I still think there’ll be more akin to reality.</p>

<p>It’ll be worse than what they say.</p>

<p>So rather than an unemployment rate at or above the natural rate as it is within the last couple of months I would expect to see the unemployment rate go forward ahead in their forecast.</p>

<p>I would expect the unemployment very to be at the point next year.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Vince you’re on the same side as Deutsche Bank then Vincent Reinhart of Dreyfus and Mellon potentially four five percent unemployment to Eddie to say that today.</p>

<p>Do you think Lisa in the projections because right now that something close to full on unemployment does it really matter.</p>

<p>I mean I think from it from a strategic point of view people are going to be looking to see whether they pull a Bank of England and they give a dose of honesty.</p>

<p>But does it really matter if they reflect that in their forward projections if there is a general sense that they bring growth lower and they bring the inflation rate higher they bring their rates higher then you’re basically you can extrapolate what you want it from that.</p>

<p>We’ll catch up with Diane Swonk a little bit later from KPMG.</p>

<p>And thank Diane said the last few summary of economic projections.</p>

<p>We’ve had the last few set of forecasts.</p>

<p>We’ve had Tom from this fund of research.</p>

<p>She’s called them aspirational fanciful I think was the phrase gone.</p>

<p>It used as well.</p>

<p>Maybe we’ve migrated from fanciful here in the last X number of weeks John.</p>

<p>Four week moving average on jobless claims that come out weekly.</p>

<p>You take a four week moving average you know the math two hundred twenty four thousand.</p>

<p>That is so far not from a five percent unemployment rate.</p>

<p>I just find the whole conference Tom.</p>

<p>That’s the point.</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank is making.</p>

<p>This is what Magnus said.</p>

<p>Peter trying to say that to get inflation lower bites into this economy you need rates much higher.</p>

<p>That’s that.</p>

<p>That’s that.</p>

<p>That’s the position.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>We witnessed it.</p>

<p>I mean every airline’s packed.</p>

<p>I don’t know if the airlines are going to make money.</p>

<p>We’ve got certain Uber bulls like Jim Glassman of J.P.</p>

<p>Morgan saying look here’s where the consumer is right now.</p>

<p>They’ve got a tough task.</p>

<p>If the theory is we’re hearing on the show are to play out and then we’ve got Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley Tom he’s just been right.</p>

<p>Right right.</p>

<p>For the whole of 2012.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>To be bearish on this equity market the equity market is where it is with the VIX at twenty six point nine seven John.</p>

<p>And you know the classic rule is there’s no thanks till 30 and you may get on Mike Wilson 30 on VIX.</p>

<p>The damage is in the bond market.</p>

<p>John the institutional mass Lisa knows this better than me.</p>

<p>The institutional mass that is losing money daily in the bond market is unmeasurable.</p>

<p>I’ve never seen in my lifetime it’s piling up in a big way at least with FedEx came out last week.</p>

<p>I think we both thought the same thing.</p>

<p>We both thought of Mike and the colleagues making on antics that we’ve had the right shock and now we’re going to see the consequences of it.</p>

<p>And what is the read through to job cuts.</p>

<p>And I say that as we look for a path to get to that greater area a few less slack in the labor market.</p>

<p>We talk about a four and a half to five percent unemployment rate and you start to wonder how quickly.</p>

<p>Are these forecasts getting downgrades and our gap is Boeing is a you know some of these companies that are coming out compass are those outliers.</p>

<p>Or is that going to be much more common.</p>

<p>What would make my Wilson constructive on this equity market again.</p>

<p>You can ask.</p>

<p>The man from Morgan Stanley joins us next.</p>

<p>Looking forward to our futures.</p>

<p>Up four tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P on this Fed decision day with Tom Keene Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro futures a positive.</p>

<p>From New York Adam Radio seen on TV.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance.</p>

<p>What’s been really the engine here has been the strength of the labor market.</p>

<p>The strength of the consumer.</p>

<p>Then June 17 below is not that far away from here.</p>

<p>It’s not a heroic call to say that anymore.</p>

<p>We’re also not convinced that the data is going to be bad enough that it’s going to take us down through new lows for the back end of the Fed.</p>

<p>We’ll have to shift and or we’re just going to go into a deeper recession than we may already be in.</p>

<p>The Fed funds rate will overcome the rate of inflation.</p>

<p>That’s when the Fed has done enough.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Good morning everyone.</p>

<p>Jonathan Ferro.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Tom Keene.</p>

<p>On Thursday.</p>

<p>So much to talk about.</p>

<p>Richard.</p>

<p>Clara will join us the former vice chairman of the Fed to lead our Fed coverage today.</p>

<p>John I want to switch from the Fed to the stock market with Mike Wilson coming up.</p>

<p>There is a toxic brew out there.</p>

<p>There’s blood on the street and Mike’s got it right.</p>

<p>Oh yeah.</p>

<p>He’s dead.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Dead on.</p>

<p>Basically look for the right shock and now look for the earnings concern.</p>

<p>And are we starting to see that with companies like FedEx like Ford in the last week off the Gulfstream.</p>

<p>What I notice is the Bloomberg total return bond index.</p>

<p>John it is through to new lows breaching the June lows that we’ve seen the 60 40 Bloomberg index down 17 percent from the peak.</p>

<p>There’s nowhere to hide.</p>

<p>Bob Michael Barr J.P.</p>

<p>Morgan.</p>

<p>Tom says it’s going to get worse.</p>

<p>He’s looking for Fed funds maybe to get close to 5 percent for treasuries at 4.5 and for high yield spreads to go somewhere close to 750.</p>

<p>His message is not to buy yet to wait to be patient to wait for a recession that he thinks is coming soon.</p>

<p>She was expert at unknown.</p>

<p>I said who is that woman in print.</p>

<p>Lisa Abramowitz expert on the spread market.</p>

<p>Lisa the spread market always says so much.</p>

<p>What’s it say this morning as we go to Mike Wilson saying there’s a little more fear it’s just be getting around the edges but not getting carried away.</p>

<p>And there is a question of what exactly it’s pricing in because it’s still far below some of the heights are the other times when we’ve seen not only rate hiking but also credit fears.</p>

<p>When does this problem this goes directly to Mike Wilson.</p>

<p>When does the issue with rates bleed over to an economic pain story.</p>

<p>We’ve seen that play out in certain equities.</p>

<p>Have we seen it fully play out in credit.</p>

<p>You know J.P.</p>

<p>Morgan at least J.P.</p>

<p>Morgan Asset Management.</p>

<p>But Michael that aside like how he doesn’t think that we’ve seen enough not the equity research and investment banks that you reply.</p>

<p>I mean.</p>

<p>Well I mean out of that zero hedge message me a moment ago and asked if Bob.</p>

<p>Bob Michael Barr spoken to Macca recently.</p>

<p>Let’s read between the lines.</p>

<p>I’m not here.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>In the guys are running here.</p>

<p>I’m going to get the daily check going if we need to get to Mike Wilson for Global Wall Street.</p>

<p>Unreal.</p>

<p>On television.</p>

<p>And John Effect speaks volumes.</p>

<p>It is the litmus paper of the system.</p>

<p>Yen up through 144 fractionally.</p>

<p>Euro visited new weakness in sterling.</p>

<p>We couldn’t support a john on our trip there.</p>

<p>I try.</p>

<p>You tried 30 40 fucking a snapshot of foreign exchange right now on a stronger against everything.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Swiss franc a sad defensive thinks out euro dollar negative six tenths of one percent and just about holding on to ninety nine on euro dollar ninety nine.</p>

<p>0 8 yields down 3 basis points.</p>

<p>They’ve been so much higher recently over the last few weeks in fact for the 10 year the last two months 352 seventy on a 10.</p>

<p>Yet some futures just a bit firmer up a third of 1 percent on the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>It is so true that the media the financial media loves to look at strategists who say are you’re right or wrong you’ve failed you’re done.</p>

<p>The reality is the way strategists are used on Wall Street and no one has given more guidance this year in the last 12 months.</p>

<p>And Michael Wilson CIO and chief U.S.</p>

<p>equity strategist at Morgan Stanley because it’s been a consistent and cogent message of beware the future.</p>

<p>Mike we are now where we have a Mike Wilson stock market.</p>

<p>And what I note is you mention it is picked over.</p>

<p>I can’t find scale.</p>

<p>There’s not enough to choose from.</p>

<p>Where do I hide.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Well thanks Tom appreciate your kind words.</p>

<p>I mean look I think the I mean the market is picked over because this is where we are in the evolution of this bear market.</p>

<p>Essentially when bear markets began they always go after the High Flyers you know things that are kind of ridiculously priced or where their earnings risk is as more evident.</p>

<p>And that’s what happened really kind of earlier this year late last year quite frankly really began almost a year ago and out.</p>

<p>But as you kind of go through people didn’t.</p>

<p>Hi it’s like the water rises.</p>

<p>You go to the higher part of the mountain.</p>

<p>And so it really is kind of crammed into the same stuff just kind of waiting for some conclusion to the story.</p>

<p>Either we avoid a recession and move forward of a soft landing or we down and we clear the decks and then we can move forward from there.</p>

<p>We’re kind of more in the second camp because our view on earnings is just so negative.</p>

<p>Whether we have a recession or not all of our top down models which are pretty good are telling us that you know the spread between our forecast and the actual forecast by the street would mean bottoms up is has never been wider.</p>

<p>It’s only time it’s been as wide as you know in 0 8 and then back in 0 1.</p>

<p>And we know what happened there.</p>

<p>So the earnings story is what we’re focused on.</p>

<p>I mean the Fed is important still.</p>

<p>Obviously they’re not getting off the gas here on their hawkishness and nor should they.</p>

<p>But that’s pretty priced to me.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if today we get some relief quite frankly led by the bond market after the Fed does their thing.</p>

<p>Maybe stocks can rally one more time but the end game for us is all about the earnings and the growth now.</p>

<p>And we’re you know we’re just not optimistic there for the next six to 12 months.</p>

<p>And net value price pretty quickly see growth steady 400 is the base case 50 percent probability.</p>

<p>Mike 3000 the back case recession scenario 40 percent probability.</p>

<p>I put out this research that quote on Twitter in the last week and a lot of people wanted to know why the other 10 percent.</p>

<p>Mike IBEX the 10 percent.</p>

<p>Yeah that’s that’s the mystery.</p>

<p>Now I mean it’s pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>I mean the Bolt case is just not that probable.</p>

<p>I think you know November and we talked about this as you recall gentlemen the Bolt case was Goldilocks.</p>

<p>And we said well you know the probability of Goldilocks looks pretty unlikely.</p>

<p>So we bought case.</p>

<p>You know we can flex that from you know zero or not really.</p>

<p>05 that 20 percent were you know sort of 5 to 10 percent now.</p>

<p>But the bull case is not in the latter.</p>

<p>Goldilocks it’s kind of a soft landing for the economy.</p>

<p>However that’s not a soft landing for earnings.</p>

<p>So you know our bolt case is not much different from our from our base case.</p>

<p>I mean we think we think maybe you don’t make new lows in the Bolt case but there’s an upside.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Over the next six months.</p>

<p>And that’s really how we manage money.</p>

<p>I mean we we look at risk reward and you know at thirty nine hundred and the risk reward is probably five to one.</p>

<p>You know on the downside is sort of the sort of the middle of our of our viewpoint and that’s at the S&amp;P level.</p>

<p>Let me just clear because Tom asked a question which is you know this is the part of the bear market.</p>

<p>We should be looking for individual stocks that you want to own coming out of this.</p>

<p>Some are priced appropriately where you want to take that risk.</p>

<p>But look what happened this week with Fed Ex.</p>

<p>I mean clearly that wasn’t priced.</p>

<p>So you gotta be really careful thinking oh well everyone knows this.</p>

<p>It’s already priced and you get hit over the head and the stock’s down 20 percent.</p>

<p>So that’s you know everybody has their own risk tolerance.</p>

<p>They have their own work.</p>

<p>And you know we have our own focused list as well.</p>

<p>We’re staying defensively oriented.</p>

<p>We’re not reaching for cyclicality or you know kind of crazy growth stocks yet.</p>

<p>We think it’s premature for that.</p>

<p>But we’re getting closer.</p>

<p>I mean we think we’re within a couple of months probably.</p>

<p>So there’s an issue with how long this is going to last.</p>

<p>We were speaking yesterday with Chris Brown.</p>

<p>You talked of a lost decade of profits on the headline level for the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>Just based on the fact that yields are going remain higher inflation is going to be greater.</p>

<p>Do you agree or do you think they’re going to get a rebound on the other side of this six months 12 months down the line.</p>

<p>Yeah I mean I think we will get a rebound but we are view for a while now has been we’ve moved out of the monetary policy dominated world to a fiscal dominant policy world.</p>

<p>And what that means is that the Fed is no longer in other central banks quite frankly can no longer smooth over the edges the way they have historically because inflation while maybe it’s going to come down in the next six months which is our core view it’s not going away it’s going to be dormant and then we’ll re accelerate again in the next upturn.</p>

<p>What’s going to happen.</p>

<p>Lisa I think is that you’re going to clear the decks and up on expectations on growth that you can then have a week celebration and that will be driven by the natural ebbing and flowing of supply and demand but also more aggressive fiscal policy.</p>

<p>I think it’s interesting to note in the last month I mean fiscal policy has been turned down like a spigot again.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>We have this debt forgiveness program here.</p>

<p>We have the 200 billion pound stimulus for energy subsidies in the UK which is equivalent to a trillion dollars in a U.S.</p>

<p>economic standpoint.</p>

<p>So it’s kind of interesting when you have kind of raised worry about inflation but the fiscal policy is working counter productively to the monetary tightening.</p>

<p>But that’s the way I think we’re living in now.</p>

<p>And you have to understand that because it’s not all bearish.</p>

<p>It will be a time when fiscal picks it up again next year even though monetary can’t do its job as has been doing in the past.</p>

<p>And in the Fed’s job in my view and the ECB is you.</p>

<p>It’s abuse job in my view.</p>

<p>Their main job going forward is to be funding the government whatever the government decides to spend.</p>

<p>They will have to fund implicitly very similar to the 40s analog that we’ve been using.</p>

<p>Mike just one final question and I think it’s lost in the conversations I often see with you that it’s not just about an index level code with even the team.</p>

<p>There is some single name stuff in the mix too.</p>

<p>Could you help us with just a call right now something you do like in this equity markets something that has worked these sticking with.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I mean I think like the managed care stocks have been terrific.</p>

<p>Mean that’s an area that you know these are either gross DAX and they don’t they know they’re not priced as gross DAX.</p>

<p>They never happen because of concerns about perhaps regulatory oversight and things like that.</p>

<p>But you know health care in general I would argue is an area of the market where you have pent up demand from the pandemic as opposed to payback in demand like for technology spending or consumer goods and for whatever reason is still trades really cheaply.</p>

<p>And once again it goes back to this idea that there may be fear about real pricing controls and things like that.</p>

<p>But that’s to me that’s a fair pitch.</p>

<p>And you know that that’s an area we’ve had a lot of exposure be it on pharma managed care some of the cheaper areas of private health care.</p>

<p>And I think that continues to work.</p>

<p>Other area would be say integrated energy companies where they’re more defensively oriented not so dependent on the price deck.</p>

<p>They pay great dividend and you get some commodity exposure you know as a hedge against your inflation staying sticky or high.</p>

<p>But the overriding message John as you know this year if must have been defensive earnings stability operational efficiency boring type metrics.</p>

<p>But you know it’s been working nicely and I think it will continue until we get the trough in this bear market.</p>

<p>It’s been working in a tough tough year.</p>

<p>Congrats to you.</p>

<p>And that same Mike Wilson so far for 2022.</p>

<p>Just absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley T.K.</p>

<p>a man whose code along with his team really ready well for the year so far.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>What’s important is how they dovetail.</p>

<p>And I really can’t say enough about the fractious nature of Morgan Stanley research.</p>

<p>I love John how they’re argumentative and visibly argumentative.</p>

<p>You saw that was Zentner moving from transitory to a more difficult inflation along with pretty much everyone has some sound from that.</p>

<p>Futures future’s up four tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>It is Fed decision day for our audience worldwide.</p>

<p>Heard on radio seen on TV.</p>

<p>This is Glenn Beck.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Mateo.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin declares it a fight to the death with the U.S.</p>

<p>and its allies.</p>

<p>He’s calling up three hundred thousand reserve troops in a major escalation of the war in Ukraine who also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>He said that the U.S.</p>

<p>and its allies want to destroy Russia.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian counter offensive in the last few weeks has dealt Russian troops their worst defeats since the early months of the conflict.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates today to the highest level since 2008.</p>

<p>And it’s likely to forecast that there will be further increases for the third straight meeting.</p>

<p>Policymakers are expected to raise rates by 75 basis points.</p>

<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to stress the Fed’s resolve to curb inflation.</p>

<p>That’s near a 40 year high.</p>

<p>The Bank of Japan is trying to cap upward pressure on yields before a policy decision later this week.</p>

<p>The central bank announced an unscheduled bond buying operation DOJ.</p>

<p>Governor hurry go.</p>

<p>Kuroda has emphasized his determination to maintain rock bottom interest rates even though many other developed nations are increasing them.</p>

<p>And Amazon’s cargo airline is growing at the slowest pace since the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Researchers with the DePaul University’s Chaddock Institute of Metropolitan Development say the number of flights on the company’s air freighters rose just three point eight percent between March and September.</p>

<p>The e-commerce giant has already closed or delays plans for dozens of warehouses.</p>

<p>Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Mateo.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>I think it’s unsustainable to have the Fed hiking rates at a very rapid rate doing Kuti with you know the economy slowing at some stage of the game.</p>

<p>The Fed will have to shift and or you know we’re just going to go into a deeper recession than we may already be.</p>

<p>Kathy Jones that of Charles Schwab governments that Fed decision that a bit later this afternoon futures hang up.</p>

<p>I said if 1 percent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq up a tenth of 1 percent.</p>

<p>Max Kanter of HSBC just published in Hetchy.</p>

<p>When touts I lose we retain our maximum underweight in equities.</p>

<p>If growth continues to hold up central banks will have to do more to slam the brakes putting pressure on valuations.</p>

<p>And he goes on to say.</p>

<p>But if activity disappoints quickly falling growth and earnings expectations will also be bad for risk assets.</p>

<p>Tellme tails.</p>

<p>I lose heads.</p>

<p>You win.</p>

<p>Can we stayed in London over that long duration of wonderful stay there amid the sadness for England.</p>

<p>Max Kuttner was our gloomiest guest.</p>

<p>I think it was.</p>

<p>He was also a bit of a highlight at the same time.</p>

<p>Thomas tried to catch up with him like Mike Wilson clip me but right through to 2020.</p>

<p>Anyone tried to get me brought the walk round my slipped.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>It takes a while my Mikey.</p>

<p>Thank you Carrie.</p>

<p>Have you.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Let’s just go around the room.</p>

<p>Maybe not.</p>

<p>It’s true.</p>

<p>And also her grand banks 40 42 as if that’s what it says John.</p>

<p>Gloomy but right.</p>

<p>Is that what he says.</p>

<p>Bumper sticker over boat right now.</p>

<p>Michael McKee with us here as we go forward into the Fed meeting.</p>

<p>And again Richard Claire is scheduled to be with us which is wonderful.</p>

<p>Mike I have such a respect for your ability to drill down into this minutia.</p>

<p>I just am unable to do it.</p>

<p>Which of the forecast.</p>

<p>Which of the dots.</p>

<p>What is the item you will look for first when they release that stuff this afternoon.</p>

<p>Well I think we’re going to be looking at the median dot which does come out in the S&amp;P as well as on the dot plot.</p>

<p>Because what people want to know on Wall Street is how fast are they going to get to terminal and what do they think.</p>

<p>Terminal is.</p>

<p>And then the third question is how long is it going to stay there.</p>

<p>So all three questions will be sort of answered in one line on the economic projections.</p>

<p>Then we’ll also look at unemployment because the Fed has got a forecast under its dot plot what it thinks unemployment will be.</p>

<p>And that sort of tells you what they think is acceptable in terms of unemployment.</p>

<p>If if it follows the book and unemployment goes up so far they haven’t had a whole lot of luck pushing that up to the top.</p>

<p>For those of you on radio you’re advantaged right now because we just showed the dot plot.</p>

<p>It looks like the landing effort at JFK and a blizzard Michael McKee.</p>

<p>Beyond that there will be the questions today.</p>

<p>It’s unfair to say what is a question you will ask.</p>

<p>What does he not want to say in the press conference today.</p>

<p>Oh he doesn’t want to say anything about a possible pivot one way or another whether he uses that word or another.</p>

<p>He doesn’t want to suggest that the Fed is in any way going to back off at least for a year maybe longer.</p>

<p>We’ll see in the dot plot how long they keep rates up.</p>

<p>You look at what Fed funds futures are pricing and they see the Fed starting to cut rates in May of 2023.</p>

<p>And that is exactly the feeling the Fed doesn’t want to encourage.</p>

<p>They want people who think the Fed is going to get rates up and keep them there until inflation goes down.</p>

<p>Mike does the Fed have a serious credibility problem.</p>

<p>I don’t think so.</p>

<p>It’s kind of funny the comment you were leading in with about heads I lose tails you win is kind of an admission that the Fed is going to do what it’s going to do.</p>

<p>And they’re looking at how that’s going to impact asset classes.</p>

<p>I think they do need to follow through.</p>

<p>If they were to back off at any sign of weakness in the economy then they would have a credibility problem.</p>

<p>But so far when you look at the inflation expectations they’re relatively anchored.</p>

<p>They’re actually coming down a little bit.</p>

<p>So I think people are have bought into the Fed’s program at this point.</p>

<p>One of the biggest unknowns right now is how long it’s going to take for this economy to truly feel higher rates.</p>

<p>And the reason why this is important is because some people argue that the Fed won’t know if they dramatically overshoot until it’s too late.</p>

<p>How much are people gaming out the length of time that duration it takes before we start to see the ramifications of a 4 percent Fed funds rate.</p>

<p>Well you’ve got sort of two camps out there one that thinks the Fed can maybe bring us in for a soft landing.</p>

<p>And if it doesn’t it’ll be a mild recession and it’ll come probably later next year.</p>

<p>And there are others who think they’ve already gone too far and we’re going to head into the teeth of recession fairly soon.</p>

<p>And you see that reflected in those Fed funds futures.</p>

<p>But the problem for the Fed is the data they watch to see where they are is backward looking and the effects of their policies is forward looking with the lags.</p>

<p>So they’ve got to try to extrapolate between the two.</p>

<p>And it isn’t easy.</p>

<p>And that is a question on my list for Jay J.</p>

<p>How are you going to know where you are and whether or not you’ve gone too far and CAC.</p>

<p>They have always said well we know how to deal with inflation.</p>

<p>So if if inflation went up too high we would know what to do.</p>

<p>We could pivot right away.</p>

<p>But what if the opposite is true.</p>

<p>The economy starts to really fall and the Fed doesn’t know that’s happening yet.</p>

<p>Mark McKay thank you.</p>

<p>Mike thank you very much.</p>

<p>And looking forward to the news conference with Mike McKenna’s conference later on the Fed.</p>

<p>SHUGG the Fed decides least we talked about that anyway.</p>

<p>Is the Fed being emboldened by a lagging indicator.</p>

<p>I mean basically that’s the issue at a time when you start to see the Fed ex ISE of the world come out and say things are moving so quickly they have to readjust their forecasts.</p>

<p>FedEx might be dealing with some specific issues that has to do with FedEx and FedEx alone.</p>

<p>But we’re also seeing it from other companies.</p>

<p>At what point does that become relevant for the Fed.</p>

<p>Is that data that they’re going to track.</p>

<p>And Annmarie Horden said he just published he said a hawkish surprise would be power suggesting upcoming hikes remain larger in size or that neutral policy rates have migrated higher.</p>

<p>A less likely deficit outcome would be pound emphasizing that policy rate increases were slower pause at some point some once again the news conference often about emphasis of the Fed chair and also the markets going to be watching.</p>

<p>And we’re going to correlate all that into 2 p.m.</p>

<p>here on equities bonds currencies commodities.</p>

<p>John moments ago Euro Swiss he made a dash to news with strength.</p>

<p>I would suggest if Russia fears Putin fears and that.</p>

<p>But we’re at a point where dollars on the cusp of breaking out we’re not there yet.</p>

<p>But can you imagine dollar strength into the press conference.</p>

<p>I can’t because we’ve seen it right now.</p>

<p>Let’s say right now one 77 111 potentially going into this VIX y same thing.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Euro dollar just clinging on to ninety nine sterling Lisa 113 levels that if we’d mentioned at the start of the year I would have laughed and pointed that out just yesterday in yesterday’s conversation.</p>

<p>That’s right.</p>

<p>What credit does Chris Brown was.</p>

<p>He said in the commercial break you said John I watched bank one of our interviews out of the shadows.</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p>Here we go.</p>

<p>I said 150 on telly and you laughed at me.</p>

<p>And guess what.</p>

<p>We’re not at 150.</p>

<p>Good jobs said he said you totally missed it.</p>

<p>We’re only at 144.</p>

<p>A terrible cold.</p>

<p>It’s going to keep everything that you’re going to stick to it.</p>

<p>He’s a great coach.</p>

<p>Let’s give it to Chris.</p>

<p>143 98 on.</p>

<p>He and Michael Pond’s going to join us from Barclays.</p>

<p>Just a moment here.</p>

<p>A dollar just holding on to ninety nine negative seven tenths of one percent.</p>

<p>This is pulling back.</p>

<p>Live from New York City this morning.</p>

<p>Good morning to you.</p>

<p>Just about positive on the S&amp;P for half of 1 percent on the S&amp;P 500 futures up on the Nasdaq my third of 1 percent.</p>

<p>Oh so pushing higher yields pushing lower by 4 basis points on a 10 year 350 to 60 euro dollar just about holding on to 99 99 0 6.</p>

<p>That currency peg negative six tenths of one per cent.</p>

<p>Some real lift on a strength out there in the mix.</p>

<p>Shout out to post say on Twitter.</p>

<p>We can rename the program simple.</p>

<p>In fact the Brit the bad and the bow tie right away to start the day.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for that.</p>

<p>I think that works.</p>

<p>We should rename the podcast The Brit the band the bow tie.</p>

<p>You know we could do that.</p>

<p>I think the podcast that works as well as in IBEX beautifully digital product.</p>

<p>And in fact over the years you know the digital products becoming more and more important including podcasts.</p>

<p>We’re working on that every day with Scott Havens and we move forward on that.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve all returned.</p>

<p>Right now we return to what started the program years ago which is speak to people that actually spend 24/7 on something narrow and excellent.</p>

<p>David Rosenberg passing inflation maybe Steven Englander in his brilliant work on cross rates and effects.</p>

<p>One of those some years ago was Michael Pond.</p>

<p>His fancy title now as head of global inflation linked research at Barclays far more accurately.</p>

<p>He is truly expert.</p>

<p>With the exception maybe of Ian Lincoln at BMO on full faith and credit.</p>

<p>And he joins us today Michael Pond.</p>

<p>If I look at the real yield and I look at two partial differentials of the nominal yield and some measurement of inflation which matters right now it’s the real yield that matters.</p>

<p>And it’s moved up a lot over the summer.</p>

<p>The market was was not really buying into the Fed’s resolve to hike rates enough to slow the economy and getting inflation down.</p>

<p>Since Jackson Hole though really yields have have soared particularly at the front end where they were almost at at zero earlier this month.</p>

<p>Now they’re above 1 percent.</p>

<p>When we look at short and forward so the markets move a lot and really accepted the hawkish tone of the Fed.</p>

<p>So if I look not at the 10 year real yield but Michael parties go shorter to maybe the two year if you agree with me on that from a negative 300 basis points conversion to a positive 164 basis points that’s a hugely linear jump condition.</p>

<p>How do other asset classes react to the Michael Pond world.</p>

<p>Well risk assets do not love higher yields that are not supported by strong growth.</p>

<p>Really we’re where real yields are rising here is because the Fed has become much more hawkish trying to slow the economy.</p>

<p>And that’s in part why risk assets have been on the back foot since Jackson Hole.</p>

<p>So the Fed’s trying to get the economy in a position where inflation comes down and then it can take its foot off the off the brake a little bit and allow growth to go back up to where we think we’re years from that.</p>

<p>The Fed’s resolve is strong here.</p>

<p>That was clear at the at the Jackson Hole speech by by Chair Powell ripping up this go off the script then and channeling his inner Volcker risk assets have responded.</p>

<p>But now they’re at the point where perhaps they’ve overreacted.</p>

<p>You know obviously we’ll we’ll get the message from the Fed that’s on the hawkish side.</p>

<p>But markets are already prepared for a very hawkish Fed.</p>

<p>So it’s a delicate balance today.</p>

<p>Before we veer too far into that they might be prepared for a hawkish Fed.</p>

<p>There’s a question of how quickly that leads to economic integration and we can get there.</p>

<p>But I want to sit on this idea right now of what it means to have a Volcker ISE Federal Reserve particularly with real rates at the highest levels going back to 2011.</p>

<p>Do you foresee ever again in the next few decades this Federal Reserve going back to zero interest rates.</p>

<p>It’s very possible.</p>

<p>You know we thought that the market was pricing in too much of too high of a probability of strong Fed cuts.</p>

<p>And next year in late summer those that basically had been taken out as appropriate.</p>

<p>But we certainly if you look at the housing market and say the housing market becomes a sign of the broader economic outlook it then then we could be in trouble here and the Fed would have to respond putting its dull hat back on.</p>

<p>We think we’re not likely to enter that that regime but it’s certainly possible that we enter a recession.</p>

<p>They’ve had has to recover.</p>

<p>You know backtrack and send rates right back to zero.</p>

<p>Well OK.</p>

<p>So this is sort of the big attention right now in bond markets particularly on the long end with your tenure yields at the highest levels that they’ve been going back years and years.</p>

<p>And yet some people including Michael Collins from PJM Fixed Income earlier are saying it’s unclear whether it’s really time to pounce because there could be more.</p>

<p>Is this the last time.</p>

<p>We’ll see real yields of this level because this Fed is poised to make some sort of turn in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>I think it 100 percent depends on the path of core inflation readings and the labor market.</p>

<p>That’s why the Fed is reacting so hawkish.</p>

<p>Lee here they’ve done quite a bit.</p>

<p>Some parts of the economy is has begun to slow such as the housing market.</p>

<p>But the latest print on core CPI was point six.</p>

<p>And labor markets clearly remain quite quite quite quite robust at a three point seven percent unemployment rate.</p>

<p>The Fed really needs to see a slowdown in the monthly pace of inflation readings particularly on core and a weakening of the labor market again.</p>

<p>The chair talked about inducing pain in the economy again channeling his inner Volcker in order to get inflation down.</p>

<p>So the Fed has to do a lot more to get get the economy where it wants.</p>

<p>Michael you embrace a dual mandate and I get that.</p>

<p>You know we could talk all day about jobless claims.</p>

<p>This and the other thing are true mean Dallas.</p>

<p>Maybe the chairman will bring that up today.</p>

<p>He’s got another mandate which is the credibility that he said but just up against political realities.</p>

<p>If we get a Barclays recession if we get a Barclays sort of recession does that become a third mandate for this chairman.</p>

<p>Well the Fed is absolutely trying to make sure it retains credibility particularly with CAC when it comes to inflation fighting.</p>

<p>So one of the reasons why it’s being so hawkish here is to make sure that inflation expectations don’t get out of control because that’s when the Fed fears an inflationary spiral where inflation is high.</p>

<p>People expect it to be high and it just feeds on itself.</p>

<p>So one of the things the Fed is trying to do here is make sure that high inflation itself doesn’t lead to higher inflation expectations.</p>

<p>So it’s trying to maintain its credibility.</p>

<p>And if we look at break evens if we look at surveys such as that from the New York Fed or the University of Michigan the Fed is doing a good job on that front and it’s able to ignore any political issues with it with a slowdown.</p>

<p>John I’m sorry politics matters here.</p>

<p>It’s going to matter tomorrow for Bank of England.</p>

<p>It’s going to matter today for Chairman Paul.</p>

<p>So I don’t disagree.</p>

<p>And I think Michael this is going to be the difficult part.</p>

<p>How do they convince people that high unemployment is a price worth paying for lower inflation.</p>

<p>Easy to say that now but when people actually start to see materially higher unemployment how difficult do you think this is going to get.</p>

<p>Well that’s why the S&amp;P the survey of economic projections or the dots if you will all be so important today.</p>

<p>When we get the statement when we look at the statement one of things we’ll be looking at is the unemployment rate path.</p>

<p>So you know the ACP is supposed to be the economic outlook under a path of of perfect monetary policy.</p>

<p>And if the unemployment rate remains elevated in their forecasts that’s a signal to the market that they’re willing to tolerate decently higher unemployment rates in order to get inflation down.</p>

<p>That’s a message that the Fed has been sending.</p>

<p>But we’ll really be looking at the S&amp;P to confirm that.</p>

<p>Michael just real quick here I’m wondering what your projection is for how quickly inflation will come down that headline CPI at the end of this year at the end of next.</p>

<p>We’re fairly optimistic that it will start to slow particularly with the October reading in part because of technical reasons at least in CPI.</p>

<p>But even beyond that again we’ve seen signs in commodities and shipping rates in an ag related futures.</p>

<p>Corn wheat etc.</p>

<p>that many price pressures have peaked.</p>

<p>Wages though are keeping inflation high and that’s the key to inflation really rolling over.</p>

<p>Michael just quickly what are you talking about in terms of levels going to end the year at 6 percent at 4 percent.</p>

<p>What do we got.</p>

<p>We think we’ll we’ll certainly come down from that when it comes to headline inflation in part because of the strong decline in gasoline prices since since March.</p>

<p>But core can remain sticky.</p>

<p>So while we think will slow and inflation readings but certainly well above where the Fed would like them.</p>

<p>A punt if.</p>

<p>Please.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have one.</p>

<p>Barclays went very quiet when this interview started.</p>

<p>I can tell you the commercial break.</p>

<p>It was this beautiful but yes.</p>

<p>Hum.</p>

<p>Coming off the trading floor.</p>

<p>ISE Barclays.</p>

<p>Tom wasn’t it fantastic as they put it thanks to Michael to see your manager in a memo today Bondeson was surveillance so they should just hide and seek.</p>

<p>It’s just beautiful.</p>

<p>Just like old mr.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>And frankly for Q4 and into next year that’s a big debate John.</p>

<p>The Guardian in London and the acclaimed Ian Frazier one of the great authors and thinkers of economics in your United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I love what he resurrects from Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>Trickle down economics.</p>

<p>John is that what you are observing.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>You should probably have a look at the modern Wolf piece in the Financial Times as well because it was pretty scathing and was about.</p>

<p>I’m from this conservative government.</p>

<p>Well you know this is out there and in real time and you know frankly for our American listeners and viewers what goes on to morrow has a profound effect on what goes on in America.</p>

<p>We get a bank having the right decision and a many but.</p>

<p>I’ve got no idea.</p>

<p>John I met his son.</p>

<p>Start.</p>

<p>That’s what next.</p>

<p>Guess what.</p>

<p>You Matt Miller.</p>

<p>That’s important.</p>

<p>So that’s important.</p>

<p>No idea if Martin wrote this headline in the FTSE but at least the economic consequences of less trusts was the headline of that piece in the FTSE yesterday.</p>

<p>Well Danny Blanchflower over at Dartmouth he put this out.</p>

<p>Pretty predictable isn’t it.</p>

<p>David Ingles OK.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>But he said you know he said many interviews.</p>

<p>He’s discussed these disastrous economic policies of less trust as he said.</p>

<p>And he said that they’re in total disarray but it seems inadequate as pronouncements get worse daily.</p>

<p>I have never in my 50 years of doing economics seen anything as bad as this.</p>

<p>I want to see the complete package.</p>

<p>Looks like the two that we’ve heard of fear and in the cap on banker bonus says that’s going to get the wrong kind of headlines than the one that we heard of in the last 24 hours was on reducing stamp duty which anyone not familiar was just the transaction tax the pay when you buy purchase or a house in the UK time and that’s at different levels relative to how much that property costs.</p>

<p>Let’s see what the the complete package actually looks like.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>You know when I was looking in Knightsbridge yesterday.</p>

<p>That’s why I came back a day late.</p>

<p>You know they said maybe the transaction tax would be gone.</p>

<p>You trying to buy to Kate.</p>

<p>Well you know that you can go on stamp duty.</p>

<p>Just Google it and have a look at how much you’d have to pay property taxes.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>Is it like real real money.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>I mean you need the real money to begin with.</p>

<p>To find the Haslinda Amin is real money to one of five sterling or here in a very rich 113 store.</p>

<p>Are you waiting for it to decline a little bit more.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Oh yeah OK.</p>

<p>Euro dollar ninety nine twelve.</p>

<p>But a stronger dollar in the mix.</p>

<p>Equity markets firmer.</p>

<p>Yields are lower.</p>

<p>All of this going into the Fed a little bit later looking forward to a Fed decides surveillance special a little bit later.</p>

<p>Do not miss this with the former vice chair Richard Clara in the studio with the three of us breaking down the decision and going over the news conference table.</p>

<p>Do you want any more than that drama.</p>

<p>Isn’t it just fantastic.</p>

<p>On Saturday and Chairman Powers going to cut.</p>

<p>He’s no he’s not calling.</p>

<p>And his job is only here to see Brad Stone.</p>

<p>He doesn’t care about it.</p>

<p>Doesn’t care about us.</p>

<p>He said to see Lisa of course.</p>

<p>From New York this is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin is threatening to escalate the war in Ukraine even further.</p>

<p>Putin is calling up three hundred thousand reserve troops and vowed to use all means necessary to defend Russian territory.</p>

<p>He also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Kremlin is moving too swiftly to annex parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces.</p>

<p>The feds ready today to hike again and to send a hawkish message for the third meeting in a row.</p>

<p>Policymakers are expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points and that would bring rates to the highest level since 2008.</p>

<p>Chair Jerome Powell is likely to hammer home that he believes further rate hikes are needed to tame inflation.</p>

<p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says borrowing costs will rise more in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Speaking in Frankfurt Lagarde said the ECB has taken major steps to tackle inflation and she expects to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings.</p>

<p>Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than 20 700 journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>There is some thought that we’re getting to pick hawkishness but that’s not going to move the market now.</p>

<p>It’s the earnings that are good to move the market in a realistic reset of where we’re going in this.</p>

<p>Alicia Levine there on the equity markets at the NY Mellon well she’s just given us so much insight particularly with her math foundations before we move to events with United Nations General Assembly.</p>

<p>Lisa I think we’ve got to look at what’s moving in the market.</p>

<p>And just one idea off of what John was mentioning on the Bank of England tomorrow.</p>

<p>If you take the sterling Lisa and you extrapolate it out the weakening has been so rapid that we see a one point one zero ninety nine extrapolation in a cup of good British coffee September 29.</p>

<p>I find that extraordinarily Emma Chandra the fact that people are talking about the potential for parity at a time where there is a one two whammy punch of an economic backdrop on forcing the Bank of England to raise rates and then a fiscal plan that has endless spending and tax cuts that’s leaving a lot of people wondering where the foreign investment is going to come from.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to monitor this.</p>

<p>And of course we go to our full reserve coverage this afternoon with Richard Clarett.</p>

<p>And we’re just honored the vice chairman would choose to give us extended comments.</p>

<p>I’m sure he’ll be delicate there and a delicate moment for Chairman Powell.</p>

<p>Right now it is a delicate moment for anyone ever in climate.</p>

<p>I will not mince words.</p>

<p>Michael Bloomberg who signs my paycheck has been a world leader and saying forget about the big picture and look at the smaller tactical realities.</p>

<p>He provided leadership at Paris a number of years ago on this with the mayor of Paris as a dog though and does again today with the earth shock prize.</p>

<p>Francine Lacqua was covering the story and will be part of selected panels there.</p>

<p>France.</p>

<p>Francine this is the effort of the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>He is distracted with the sadness of his family.</p>

<p>What did the prince what did Prince William bring to the Earth Shot Prize Innovation Summit.</p>

<p>Well Tom this is about I think rallying the troops.</p>

<p>This is about finding small innovations as you say that could actually make a real difference in real world economies.</p>

<p>So this is very much at the city level.</p>

<p>This is incubators.</p>

<p>This is about getting funding to the right place.</p>

<p>But remember we’re here in New York.</p>

<p>And the overarching idea is that yes we see more and more climate disasters.</p>

<p>We see of course what’s burning.</p>

<p>We see the forest burning.</p>

<p>We see no water in the Rhine which is a whole host of problems.</p>

<p>But if you’re a leader and you focus of course on world poverty inflation the war in Ukraine this may not be appropriate anymore for you.</p>

<p>How is this prize in the work of Prince William changed because of the war because of the surge in energy not the threat to ESG but the idea of climate debate on a back foot due to the price of commodities and coal.</p>

<p>How has it changed the summit.</p>

<p>Well it’s changed it enormously.</p>

<p>And I think the biggest story to come out of the U.N.</p>

<p>in general was President Biden today meeting to attend the meeting to actually really laid out some of the groundwork ahead of COP 27 in Egypt saying actually had no longer time to go to that meeting.</p>

<p>Of course he said envoys but it’s not exactly the same thing as having the top boss and saying this is still a priority.</p>

<p>Again if you look at energy concerns if you look at the cost of living crisis there is a real concern which actually the United Nations director general addressed right at the start of NGO yesterday was a climate still needs to be left front and center.</p>

<p>The other question is that of course King Charles the third.</p>

<p>I know you were in London for 10 days covering of course the funeral of her his dear mother Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>It was a real spearhead in this.</p>

<p>And if you look at the U.K.</p>

<p>with all the concerns about you know sustainability that even have an energy minister who is not the biggest champion.</p>

<p>Let’s put it that way of climate change efforts.</p>

<p>It’s possible that the king has to step down for anything vocal and to really you know try and push this climate change agenda printing.</p>

<p>How has the shortage in commodities or maybe not the shortage but the higher demand on certain commodities changed the conversation in terms of what commodities will be necessary for the innovations to cleaner energy.</p>

<p>So this is one of the conversations that I used to have for example with the Glencore chief executive for last four years.</p>

<p>I mean remember they still have coal mines but a lot of these big miners and we saw some of the efforts for example from Fortescue keep on saying look it’s all well and good to transform some of these transition economies into something greener.</p>

<p>But you need cobalt you need some of the components that of course are needed not only not releases but some of the technology needed.</p>

<p>And he used to say the fact of the matter is that the government has not prepared for this.</p>

<p>He wasn’t talking about one specific government.</p>

<p>He said the U.S.</p>

<p>is not.</p>

<p>Feared for this.</p>

<p>The UK won even the Eurozone is not prepared with time.</p>

<p>And if there is still commitment from not only countries but private and public partnerships then you could see a lot of the mining companies again really ramping up some of the cobalt and some of the minerals really needed to use these components.</p>

<p>But again it’s about commitment and it’s about the money to be able to make sure that these places are secure.</p>

<p>Francine thank you so much.</p>

<p>Greatly appreciated from the Plaza Hotel and the Earth Shot Prize Innovation Summit as well.</p>

<p>And the time that we’ve got left here Lisa I think we have to frame back to just an absolutely tumultuous 2022.</p>

<p>It seems like we’ve lived two or three years just going through the years today.</p>

<p>And my great observation Lisa is we’re at a point where we’re not even to neutral yet based on all the experts we talked to.</p>

<p>It’s shocking.</p>

<p>And just to give you a sense of that more than a dozen central bank meetings and rate decisions will be had in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>As we look out at all of these nations dealing with something very new relative to the past decade or two which is inflation.</p>

<p>And one way to kind of look at this reset this regime change that we’ve been talking about.</p>

<p>Thomas take a look at the total amount of negative yielding debt outstanding.</p>

<p>This is now becoming obsolete.</p>

<p>Save for Japan.</p>

<p>We now have one point nine trillion dollars of negative yielding debt outstanding according to Bloomberg indexes.</p>

<p>Just give you some perspective.</p>

<p>That was eighteen point four trillion dollars of negative yielding debt in December of 2010.</p>

<p>These are flows of money in the flows to stabilize.</p>

<p>We had this is try to get this up right now just from the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>It’s not year to date but it’s close enough to the peaks that we’ve had.</p>

<p>Lisa the Pacific Rim X Japan which is a fiction we all understand that a 9 percent depreciation the JP Morgan emerging effects indices which is more complex an 8 percent depreciation.</p>

<p>Those are big figure numbers in foreign exchange and for the United Nations and frankly for Chairman Paul.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>An extreme visual version that John was showing earlier of 25 percent depreciation of the Japanese yen and the more violent example here.</p>

<p>But yeah especially the emerging nations.</p>

<p>How do you deal with also a double whammy of both higher commodity prices and importing inflation.</p>

<p>The fact that those commodities are paid for in dollars that are getting stronger becomes a very difficult equation especially as we head into a two year yield three point nine five percent.</p>

<p>That’s what I want to hear at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>and on to 230 in a press conference.</p>

<p>Lisa in fixed income what will you watch.</p>

<p>I mean what’s the real yield.</p>

<p>I’ll see how much people are expecting the Fed to stay out in front of inflation and not provide the same kind of accommodation that they have in the past.</p>

<p>And also just in terms of risk appetite how much if we priced in.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>I mean basically if you get real yields continuing to climb that continues to make triple evers all cash.</p>

<p>You look good to some people who might make it to your 30s spread.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Negative 41 basis points.</p>

<p>I did not realize at least.</p>

<p>This funny.</p>

<p>Isn’t that the greatest inversion going back.</p>

<p>Kate I have to look at that.</p>

<p>I I failed.</p>

<p>I didn’t do the math.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll get it right by 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>this afternoon.</p>

<p>Again we are honored that Dr.</p>

<p>Claire will join us in the 2:00 p.m.</p>

<p>hour.</p>

<p>Stay with us.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>
