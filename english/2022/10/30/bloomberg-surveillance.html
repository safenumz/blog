<p>The day to day volatility is mind boggling.</p>

<p>Traders here a whiplash.</p>

<p>And I think that’s true of people across the market.</p>

<p>We do think we’ll begin to see some moderation in inflation.</p>

<p>It’s clearly been surprising to the upside.</p>

<p>Month after month, I think investors are waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p>

<p>Have the markets seen their bottom? We’re all talking about the risk of recession.</p>

<p>But markets sell to me.</p>

<p>Don’t have it priced in.</p>

<p>The market is back in charge.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene, Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz life from New York City for our audience worldwide.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz Jonathan Ferro.</p>

<p>Equity Futures Negative T.K.</p>

<p>by four tenths of one per cent today.</p>

<p>All of big tech earnings kicking off later after the Big Sur currencies and other issue soon.</p>

<p>Equities got some free time today is going to look at as Microsoft shares, as Google’s share, as you say.</p>

<p>I got to stop tonight about 8:00 p.m., his time and look at that performance.</p>

<p>It starts today.</p>

<p>We were all on to Thursday, which is one of the busiest days of the year.</p>

<p>Did you see HSBC coming down? I read a part of London lost.</p>

<p>Your visions are moving in the wrong direction and they are a Chinese subset.</p>

<p>And I read every word of our report and HSBC, and you really wonder if that’s what’s coming down the pike.</p>

<p>The the follow on from a China with 3 percent GDP.</p>

<p>Chinese equities yesterday got absolutely hammered this morning again.</p>

<p>Lisa, renewed currency weakness for China.</p>

<p>How much is this going to really, really influence the policy when we’re talking about this yesterday? This isn’t going to necessarily be the check that it was at the United Kingdom simply because Xi Jinping doesn’t seem to care as much about the market response.</p>

<p>Still, I do wonder what businesses are going to do.</p>

<p>I mean, it’s HSBC continued to double down in China or do an increasing number of companies start moving away because it just isn’t necessarily economically sound to take a 736 40.</p>

<p>What you make of that WTNH right now, 736 40 Joel Weber just brought it up and it’s well outside to standard deviation.</p>

<p>Let’s review this.</p>

<p>Is it fixed? Is it floating? No.</p>

<p>The currency is managed around a band and right now we are definitely unmanaged on the Chinese currency.</p>

<p>I’m going to call John right now to a log access here in real China in real time.</p>

<p>You can do that in the Bloomberg terminal.</p>

<p>And there’s convexity in China.</p>

<p>There’s an acceleration here of yuan.</p>

<p>We’ve seen at terminals today, we’re selling terminals.</p>

<p>Give us an idea.</p>

<p>Let’s get to the price action this morning.</p>

<p>Good morning to you and good morning to the sales team here at Bloomberg as well.</p>

<p>Equity futures look like this.</p>

<p>Sunny S&amp;P 500 big sack reporting a little bit later after the close futures negative four tenths of one per cent on the S&amp;P, down about 15 points year or two lower by five or six basis points for 1837.</p>

<p>The euro still stuck beneath parity, 98 65, negative a tenth of 1 per cent.</p>

<p>And in a moment, some we’ll catch up with Yotam Rochester.</p>

<p>He’s looking at dollar and potentially 160.</p>

<p>160 is the number in his note this morning.</p>

<p>Everybody recalibrating their in servos later on from Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>It’s going to be interesting here to look at that.</p>

<p>I’m going to call it idiosyncratic story, but folded much in with Jordan.</p>

<p>John, is Sterling a 113 18 as we go to the Suna speech here in 30 minutes or so? It’s a massive.</p>

<p>Now what for the United Kingdom? We’ll keep it on that in about 25 minutes time, 30 minutes time.</p>

<p>Look at a crude 83 30 on WTI, Lisa, negative one point five per cent today.</p>

<p>I think it’s fair to say that the week starts today.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>I mean, this is a massive week.</p>

<p>And today we start with the tech earnings, as well as a number of economic data points, including some of the house pricing data.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P CoreLogic case Schiller Index coming out at 9 a.m.</p>

<p>along with some F each at a house price data.</p>

<p>How much do you see a rollover in house prices and how quickly does this bleed into runs? Yesterday, Joel Weber saw Red start to come down actually quite significantly.</p>

<p>But it’s not going to trickle into the CPI for kind of quite a while.</p>

<p>So at what point does it matter to the Fed? At 1 p.m., we get the U.S.</p>

<p>selling forty two billion dollars of two year notes.</p>

<p>Who shows up? Right now, we’re seeing those yields continue to climb.</p>

<p>Can we breach that four and a half percent and sell it at that level? And how many people start piling in? Because perhaps this is the peak, as we heard yesterday.</p>

<p>Some are speculating today that earnings after the bell include Microsoft and Alphabet.</p>

<p>Microsoft is expected to see the slowest growth in sales going back to 2007 17.</p>

<p>Alphabet arguably more interested in John, because that’s the advertising tool, right? That’s the snap other side of the story.</p>

<p>Are we seeing advertisers start to pull back? Could that be a sign of some kind of broader trend in the economy? Alisa, thank you.</p>

<p>Looking for the earnings a little bit later, getting earnings right now on U.P.S..</p>

<p>Here are some other numbers for you.</p>

<p>Revenue in line.</p>

<p>APAC beats some for the third quarter, 296 versus 265 year over year.</p>

<p>The estimate was to 85.</p>

<p>Adjusted EPS coming in at two ninety nine, reaffirming the outlook as well.</p>

<p>Some reaffirming the full year outlook this morning.</p>

<p>And this is important, again, on a logistics basis, a national basis with Federal Express is well, Julian Emanuel has his revenue model modeling right now up eight point eight percent revenue.</p>

<p>That’s.</p>

<p>That inflation induced revenue growth, you’re you’ve seen corporations.</p>

<p>That’s a big number.</p>

<p>Looking forward to GM added a bit later.</p>

<p>Some really want to find out what the tone is at this auto market in this country, given what’s happening with interest rates right now.</p>

<p>Tom Keene, you imagine going out and buying a new car? How much that’s going to cost you? Well, I think the interest rate story is profound and occurring with this leader has a global story on what the interest rate impact is on central banks.</p>

<p>The interest rate impact on their car is a three year depreciation year, maybe a four year depreciation.</p>

<p>And we haven’t even talked, as Lisa just alluded to, to a 7 percent mortgage.</p>

<p>What does that do in American? What’s it in the United Kingdom? I mean, no problem for autos, though, specifically.</p>

<p>I wonder if we go from undersupply to oversupply just like that in a space of 12 months.</p>

<p>That’s something UBS indicated potential.</p>

<p>Well, just a few weeks ago, we don’t talk enough about it, but this is the David Rosenberg theory.</p>

<p>There is a camp with Mr.</p>

<p>Rosenberg of Toronto that you’re going to see a rapid path to disinflation.</p>

<p>We saw that not once, John, but twice 1947 to 1953.</p>

<p>Stochastic up you go, inflation gloom.</p>

<p>Down you go.</p>

<p>Looking forward to those numbers a little bit later this morning, a Matt Miller going to catch up with the CEO of GM later on in this program.</p>

<p>We’re gonna catch up with John in Rochester now, the NFL strategist over at Nomura and Jordan.</p>

<p>I teased it a little bit earlier, a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>Let’s go there.</p>

<p>I saw the number 160 and dollar yen next to it in your note.</p>

<p>Walk us through it.</p>

<p>Well, that wasn’t my view, John.</p>

<p>It was the view from clients this time last week.</p>

<p>On Monday, I’ll sit next to you guys in that table.</p>

<p>So we met clients around the New York area and Connecticut as well.</p>

<p>And we’re looking for 155 at Nomura in dollar.</p>

<p>And I think at this Bank of Japan intervention, what you’ve clearly seen over the past, let’s say twelve hours, an extreme lack of volatility.</p>

<p>Now we’re in a 40 pit range where the previous two weeks have been a big volatile in terms of that march up to nearly 152, then that near 6 yen swing down on the intervention on Friday done during New York hours when liquidity was very thin.</p>

<p>And just after that Wall Street Journal article talking about the Fed becoming perhaps a bit more dovish in terms of when they will slowdown rate hike.</p>

<p>So I think we’ve had some temporary setbacks for that long dollar, dollar and trade.</p>

<p>But the fundamentals are still pretty clear, John, that the US interest rates are rising.</p>

<p>The Japanese are not.</p>

<p>That is your long dollar, dollar and carry trade.</p>

<p>But for me, on the fundamental side, from the trade side, the dollar yen is likely to keep rising from Japanese imports as this winds are going out and buying LNG, buying coal, buying oil, even though energy prices are cooling down seasonally as we get into winter.</p>

<p>Those prices should accelerate, pushing dollar and higher towards 155.</p>

<p>Another have the honor of a formal tea at the Bank of Japan with all the pomp and circumstance is different than the Fed folks at the Fed.</p>

<p>You’re over at Starbucks and you’re paying for it.</p>

<p>That’s how they do it in America.</p>

<p>Jordan, give us an insight on the debate at the Bank of Japan.</p>

<p>Is a Carol Massar only or is it actually a debate? They’re like there is a B.O.</p>

<p>here at Fed.</p>

<p>There’s definitely a debate Kuroda is, of course, representing the rest of the bank, Japan, when he speaks on their behalf.</p>

<p>But he is also the guy in charge.</p>

<p>And when we get to March and April, the question for clients is crowed as time comes to an end.</p>

<p>Who will be the next to lead the bank? Japan.</p>

<p>And will that lead to policy change? And if you look at rates, markets, rates, markets would tell you, yes, we think that something will change at least on the 10 year parts to the.</p>

<p>Will the band’s be wider on the yield curve control? Will they give it up altogether on the 10 year move it to the 5? If you look at the Japanese GDP curve, even 10 is below 10 years are trading above the sorts of levels set by the 10 year yield curve control.</p>

<p>So the markets are challenging the bank, Japan as we speak.</p>

<p>They’re holding onto that 10 year.</p>

<p>But the rest of the curve is pricing a change in policy to come.</p>

<p>And is the message so far for this year? Jordan, that currency vigilantes will win that we’re seeing that when it comes perhaps eventually to Japan, although it hasn’t happened yet.</p>

<p>And then it has come already to Great Britain, where you see a little bit more upside at least versus where you used to with the pound.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>Well, for the Jenny used to be everyone’s risk off hedge of choice.</p>

<p>The only clients I’ve met who are long the yen are using in their portfolio as their potential risk off in case we get dollar weakness.</p>

<p>And as you’ve seen over this past year, that just hasn’t worked.</p>

<p>The fundamentals really did change for the yen compared to the global financial crash.</p>

<p>The carry trade still drives the power.</p>

<p>It does track U.S. yields quite well.</p>

<p>But on the trade side now, the trade deficit is not your risk off currency of choice when this is a risk off driven by energy prices.</p>

<p>And then for the UK, I think the UK is the canary in the coal mine for everybody around the world.</p>

<p>Even for the US. For Janet Yellen.</p>

<p>For the Fed.</p>

<p>You don’t want to do UK seems to be the conclusion from talking to foreign policy makers when it comes to budgetary constraints.</p>

<p>Don’t push it.</p>

<p>And also when it comes to interest rates, don’t suddenly get dovish and allow inflation to run hot.</p>

<p>I know we were just talking about the previous section used car prices.</p>

<p>I think they will continue to fall perhaps quite aggressively.</p>

<p>But labor markets are really tight and the risk now is the second round effects for services and that’s a lot harder to tame than inflation dragon.</p>

<p>So I think for the time being, the Fed’s go to 75, then they’ll do 75 again, then slow down into the new year.</p>

<p>That Wall Street Journal talked about the idea of perhaps slowing down to 50s come December.</p>

<p>That’s the debate for the dollar right now.</p>

<p>That’s why euro and cable have become quite boring to trade.</p>

<p>It’s.</p>

<p>Everyone’s waiting for this Fed meeting next week.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think the message will be, nope, we’re going ahead.</p>

<p>We’re still staying hawkish and the dollar will rally and Christmas and then waiting for the CPI print the week after that.</p>

<p>Jordan Awesome.</p>

<p>NIKKEI company, as always.</p>

<p>John Rochester of Nomura.</p>

<p>John, I was talking about dollar yen there and the intervention from the Bank of Japan.</p>

<p>The team here at Bloomberg broke down the data.</p>

<p>Four fifths of the weakness in the Japanese currency this year has come outside of Japanese trading hours, and that’s why the intervention from the BMJ time is coming.</p>

<p>Guess what? Outside of Japanese trading hours.</p>

<p>It’s just completely clumsy and it comes back to core theory.</p>

<p>And I guess some people can support their core theory, but shows people are saying, you got to be kidding me.</p>

<p>One thing Jordan mentioned there.</p>

<p>It’s absolutely critical is everyone’s looking at liquidity within the system, using the United Kingdom as the example.</p>

<p>And the F are A or a house much akin to labor or a house of another time and place is spiking up and is right at the moving average from the pandemic level.</p>

<p>Jordan said RTX got boring, rather boring.</p>

<p>I don’t think that anyone’s got ISE to 150 dollar.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s boring now relative to what we’ve seen over the last few months, in fact, the whole of this year.</p>

<p>Coming up, John Barron of BlackRock.</p>

<p>Looking forward to catching up with him in the next hour.</p>

<p>A comment from him on the midterms and the importance of it in about an hour from now.</p>

<p>Looking forward to that conversation live from New York City this morning.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Mateo in the U.K., where she soon CAC spent the summer predicting that Liz Truss would trash the UK with her plans if she became prime minister.</p>

<p>Well, now his prize for being right is a chance to fix the damage trust caused her neck.</p>

<p>We’ll meet King Charles, the third today to formally replace trust.</p>

<p>It’s a rapid turnaround for Suna, who lost a trust in the race for the job.</p>

<p>Bloomberg has learned that Adidas plans to end its partnership with Kenya West in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The rapper and designer has made controversial statements, including anti-Semitic posts on social media that’s turned his easy line into a lightning rod for criticism.</p>

<p>It’s estimated the brand is accounted for up to 8 percent of Adidas sales.</p>

<p>The US won’t change its stance toward China as a result of Xi Jinping seizing more power.</p>

<p>Advisers are still trying to set up a meeting between President Biden and the Chinese leader at the conclusion of the Communist Party Congress last week.</p>

<p>Gee placed allies in top posts and pave the way for a third five year term.</p>

<p>NATO is increasingly concerned that Russia’s desperation over battlefield failures in Ukraine may lead to the Kremlin to escalate the war.</p>

<p>And that could involve a massive attack on a target like a dam or even a weapon of mass destruction.</p>

<p>NATO says that for now, there’s no sign Moscow is actually preparing for such an attack.</p>

<p>An instant messaging service, WhatsApp says it’s fixed, an issue that’s cause of widespread outage.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of users reported disruptions, including not being able to send messages or connect to the server.</p>

<p>WhatsApp is owned by metal platforms, global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake.</p>

<p>Powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>I can’t think of a Mark Gurman more consequential election that I’ve been involved in and we’ve been involved in.</p>

<p>You know, whether we maintain control of the Senate and the House is a big deal.</p>

<p>And so far, we’re running against the tide and we’re beating the tide two weeks away from the midterms.</p>

<p>The president of the United States live from New York City has the price action this morning.</p>

<p>And good morning to you.</p>

<p>Your equity mark is slightly negative on the S&amp;P 500 coming off the back of a big day of gains on the S&amp;P, a day of gains of more than one full percentage point to kick off the trading week with down about a half of 1 per cent this Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>It was a lower by six basis points for 1795 on a 10 year euro on negative a tenth of 1 percent, 98, 67.</p>

<p>And before we get deep into U.S.</p>

<p>politics, UK politics in about 15 minutes from now.</p>

<p>So we should hear from the new prime minister along as she sooner.</p>

<p>The player as he won’t be surrounded by supporters of that.</p>

<p>That’s nice.</p>

<p>And the solitary and alone.</p>

<p>Let you take a breath.</p>

<p>On this particular moment, it’s Tom Keene, three prime ministers and three cups of coffee.</p>

<p>Very difficult to implement austerity in a cost of living crisis in many places around the world.</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>We’ll talk a lot about this Lizzie BURDEN.</p>

<p>I know it loses at 10 Downing Street a bit less in about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Yes, very good right now.</p>

<p>We will catch up with Annmarie Horden in Washington.</p>

<p>We are two weeks away.</p>

<p>It is Tuesday, two weeks away from an election.</p>

<p>Emory got 18 ways to go.</p>

<p>Here’s a political he leads.</p>

<p>Go back and forth.</p>

<p>And what I sense out here is a measure of apathy.</p>

<p>Give us your summary of what turnout looks like in the character of apathy in both parties.</p>

<p>We a lot of the polls and you could see that more than 50 percent and a lot of them say that they intend to go out to vote.</p>

<p>They want to go out to vote.</p>

<p>When you think about apathy, there does seem to be a sense from voters that there is this frustration when it comes to the economy right now.</p>

<p>And that continues to show up in every single poll across the board, whether it’s a question on the economy or inflation.</p>

<p>Those are the top priorities.</p>

<p>The issue is there’s not a lot the government can do to fix that right away.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>The Democrats commonly say this is a global issue.</p>

<p>That is true.</p>

<p>They try to back away from some of the legislative measures they took that maybe the Republicans say added to inflation.</p>

<p>But overall, the world is dealing with inflation.</p>

<p>This is something that is is difficult for the current administration to try to defend, even though they are doing that.</p>

<p>But when you think of apathy, that’s where it’s coming from.</p>

<p>How can the growing impact my life? And this is what I’m struggling with.</p>

<p>And across the board, it’s gas prices.</p>

<p>It’s grocery bills.</p>

<p>And it’s paying for housing and rent to the candidates and the political experts.</p>

<p>Do they trust the polls? It’s a great question, a lot of people say you cannot trust the polls, President Biden yesterday speaking at the DNC headquarters says you cannot trust the polls because the polls have been wrong before.</p>

<p>You were just talking about really soon at the polls were wrong in United Kingdom during Brexit.</p>

<p>The polls have been wrong here in the United States.</p>

<p>But at the moment, what you are seeing and what is typical, especially for mid-term elections, is that the polls are they are getting closer and they’re getting more narrow as we head into the final 14 days.</p>

<p>We should also note that a lot of people off already even voted.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>There’s been early voting for weeks in this country.</p>

<p>It’s been really difficult to balance the domestic and the international and Marie, but the international has really hung over everything when it comes to the domestic politics.</p>

<p>How much what do you make of the fact that certain Democrats are pressuring President Biden to speak with Vladimir Putin at this tenuous moment, two weeks ahead of the election? It’s an interesting moment because we also heard similar rhetoric regarding Ukraine from the Republicans.</p>

<p>Last week, Kevin McCarthy, the leader, the Republican leader of the House, likely will be the next speaker of the House if there is going to be a red wave in terms of the House talking about they’re not going to be a blank check for Ukraine, that there is not just going to be this constant funding for Ukraine while people are dealing with kitchen table issues every day and potentially going into a recession.</p>

<p>Now you have progressives saying maybe we should start negotiating with Russia to make sure that there is a diplomatic path forward for Ukraine.</p>

<p>The White House is saying there is not going to be any negotiations with Russia unless that is what Ukraine wants.</p>

<p>They constantly say nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.</p>

<p>We should know that the progressives did come out and say we are not against with the Biden administration is doing.</p>

<p>But they do want this path forward in terms of diplomacy.</p>

<p>And that’s as a number of issues are mounting on.</p>

<p>What I’m looking forward to is in December, when there potentially needs to be more spending, whether it’s military, financial, humanitarian aid, that the Bush administration is likely going to push for Ukraine.</p>

<p>Is there going to be more pushback not just from these Republicans, but also within their own party? How much of this is also being driven just by the inflationary outlook and what is what’s going to happen with gas prices heading into the winter? It’s a great question, because, Lisa, what’s coming up at December 5th? That’s when those EU sanctions are going to bite, which means it’s going to be incredibly challenging, even if you want to be able to accept Russian crude on the global oil market.</p>

<p>You can’t because maybe the shipper or the insurance company comes from a European which are dominate in this sector, whether it’s a Cypriot or a Greek ship.</p>

<p>It’s going to be challenging to get this crude around, which is why you saw at the last G7 they discussed a price cap that at this moment is a very contentious issue, because if they cannot get this price cap aboard, allowed this Russian crude to flow, that means that this Russian crude is likely going to only stay in Russia and potentially be shut ins.</p>

<p>And that is just going to elevate this price at a very difficult time.</p>

<p>Jonathan said it yesterday, though.</p>

<p>What they have going for them right now in Europe and even in the United States is the fact that is an incredibly warm out and potentially it’s going to be a warm winter.</p>

<p>MH Thank you.</p>

<p>Dan RTS, let’s pick it up right there.</p>

<p>Happy being talked about.</p>

<p>Gas prices in Europe down by more than 70 percent from the August peak ticket, down by more than 70 percent and today down by a couple of tenths of one percent.</p>

<p>But to see them back at ninety nine is their luck in nine.</p>

<p>Normally it’s warmer.</p>

<p>So whether it’s the weather and they’ve got the supply, they got the storage up to be specific.</p>

<p>So they met their storage targets ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>We brought those headlines along the way of the last couple of months and then we started to hit some warmer weather as the cooler period starts to click in some.</p>

<p>So October has been a whole lot harder.</p>

<p>We may start to bear in mind some day it can get pretty cold in parts of Europe, even in October.</p>

<p>So that’s the good news so far.</p>

<p>And we’ll see if that continues.</p>

<p>But Sandy, that’s contributed to a lower gas price in Europe over the last week or so.</p>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Rosenberg, earlier and there’s a whole school of thought here gaming out a sustained inflation, whatever the level is, whatever the country.</p>

<p>And there’s a lot of people saying the microeconomics of the system clicks in and down.</p>

<p>You come to some form of disinflation that consistently some about a month ago, I think we were all tremendously concerned about industry getting shut down, rolling shutdowns throughout Europe, rolling blackouts throughout Europe.</p>

<p>And Lisa, now maybe you can park that for a moment, but no idea if that starts to reemerge as a conversation that weeks to come.</p>

<p>But still, we need to have a conversation about next winter and the winter after that and whether they can repeat the trick of getting that storage up to capacity where they want it to be in about twelve months from now.</p>

<p>So right now, one thing that I’ve been reading about is how there’s almost a glut of natural gas.</p>

<p>Some of these storage units.</p>

<p>So at what point do we start talking about how much of this has been priced into euro area valuations that have been completely beaten up? Gas prices right now, 98 handle in the Netherlands, still European benchmark, I mean.</p>

<p>It’s impressive.</p>

<p>Gee.</p>

<p>You know, the earnings aren’t that good.</p>

<p>We’ll talk about that.</p>

<p>Three hours away from the open about life from New York, good morning to you.</p>

<p>Your Tuesday morning price action looks a little something like there.</p>

<p>Sunny S&amp;P 500.</p>

<p>Negative a third of 1 percent after some big gains to kick off the trading week.</p>

<p>Yesterday on the S&amp;P, on the Nasdaq were down about two tenths of 1 percent.</p>

<p>This is how the bond market shaping up.</p>

<p>On Friday, we had a little look at 460 on a two year.</p>

<p>This Tuesday morning, we’re down another 4 basis points to 446 64.</p>

<p>They stay on the front end and go over to the other side of the pond, to the U.K., the gilts, the two year, two year bond yield in the U.K yesterday down 37 basis.</p>

<p>Covid biggest move in 30 years themselves.</p>

<p>Simone Foxman biggest as well.</p>

<p>The big move, lower down another 4 basis points this morning.</p>

<p>Seen that the new prime minister about to speak to them in about four minutes time.</p>

<p>The attention that shifts from him ready to the budget and then over to the Bank of England in about a week from now.</p>

<p>Your thoughts on this.</p>

<p>And John, I’m going to go to what we’ve done with Draghi at Davos and all.</p>

<p>Is this guy a technocrat like Draghi or is there something different here in the political equation? I think it would be wrong to call him a technocrat at this point.</p>

<p>Some what’s interesting to me actually at this point is whether the chancellor is Jeremy Hunt and whether we actually get the budget in the way we thought within the budget at the end of this month.</p>

<p>And what that looks like, do they go even further when it comes to spending cuts, further austerity? Possibly a loser here.</p>

<p>But, John, one final question.</p>

<p>Where does Mr Gove fit into this? Who is Michael Gove and where does he fit into the form? Probably a question for Felicity Burton and Ricci soon himself.</p>

<p>Tom Mackenzie, you read this.</p>

<p>I’m looking at GM right now.</p>

<p>Covid ended with EPA asset 225.</p>

<p>Any estimate at 189? Yeah, pretty much the other way.</p>

<p>But Mary Barra will join us later.</p>

<p>Matthew Miller will be speaking to her.</p>

<p>Let’s do this right now.</p>

<p>We need to go to 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>Lizzie Burdon is there for this historic moment.</p>

<p>There have been many moments, Lizzie.</p>

<p>What will be the distinction today as he walks from the door to the podium versus when an optimistic Liz Truss walked to the podium weeks ago? What’s the key distinction this morning? To me, the key distinction between Russia seen I can lose trust is that he is a pragmatist and he has proved that throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>He was actually accused of being a socialist, so generous with his pandemic support programs like the furlough scheme.</p>

<p>And indeed, he raised taxes to pay for healthcare, even though fundamentally he says that he is a tax cutter.</p>

<p>And European leaders are going to be hoping that that pragmatism trumps poses to Brexit as well.</p>

<p>Really soon, it’s really going to have to keep that in check on both taxes.</p>

<p>Unbreakable.</p>

<p>If he wants to keep the Tory right on his side and that along with the other employees who put him in power, not the party membership, not the public, and say that coalition is going to be fragile and and crucial.</p>

<p>There’s, you know, a lot of people on this side of the Atlantic that just want to stop talking about the UK and British politics.</p>

<p>Let’s get through the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Do we get a budget deal at the end of the month? And when the bank giving the meets, will they have a deeper understanding of how many Spanish spending cuts will actually get from this prime minister? Well, we’ve already heard from various Bank of England deputy governors in recent days, and they say the Bank of England, the Treasury have already been talking, even though reticent spokesmen will not yet confirm that the Chancellor is going to be Jeremy Hunt.</p>

<p>Although it looks increasingly likely or whether the day is going to be October the thirty first.</p>

<p>In soon knock more than any prime minister would be aware of the effect of surprising the markets.</p>

<p>And so you can probably expect that he is going to confirm who his chancellor will be and what the date of that budget will be later this afternoon, along with the rest of the cabinet.</p>

<p>Let’s how difficult is it for issuing a snack to issue cuts in words with respect to spending, given the fact that he is very wealthy, that he doesn’t necessarily represent the mainstream in any kind of populist way? I struggled to hear you say that, but in terms of this, the difficult job that lies ahead for rescue dog, even though he’s had two runs at being prime minister, the characterisation in the national press today is that the easy part is over now the difficult decisions begin.</p>

<p>But Labor leader Ken Starr has already characterizing it as austerity 2.0.</p>

<p>It’s very, very difficult politically.</p>

<p>But the good news for Russia, Su Keenan, is that he’s always said that it was going to be difficult, that he’s going to be honest with the public.</p>

<p>In fact, he resisted the temptation to say, I told you so interested nomics was imploding.</p>

<p>But he has laid the foundations to deliver these difficult decisions.</p>

<p>The thing is, he’s going to have a cabinet full of ministers who are going to want to bring back on money to spend on their pet projects.</p>

<p>And when he’s got to hold this coalition together, he’s not going to just want to disappoint anyone.</p>

<p>Test for the prime minister announced.</p>

<p>Some lecterns out in front of Number 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>It’s his first appearance as prime minister to direct address the public in the UK to say he’s on time.</p>

<p>Well, he’s got to.</p>

<p>Is he going to be one of those prime ministers that late all the time? Well, that would be a Bill Clinton record call doing a Bill Clinton in Samoa.</p>

<p>You know, I don’t know your president, but it’s in that camp to take him.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>My my head is spinning on his job.</p>

<p>Do you have a sense here as we await Russia’s sooner, that this is finally stability or is it going to be in the next two, three weeks the same chaos? Tracy Alloway.</p>

<p>There is a hope that this man is going to be the face of stability.</p>

<p>And Tom, I mentioned this and it might sound snarky, but I think it’s a hope for a lot of people in this market that after today, T.K., we can stop talking about the UK.</p>

<p>What does he have to do? To Lizzie’s point, we still need to work out who the chance is going to be.</p>

<p>Michelle, it’s gonna be Jeremy Hunt.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, okay.</p>

<p>That man needs a deeper understanding of what the fiscal approach is going to be and then it’s on to the bank having the new help from that.</p>

<p>So we just get back to where they were and we can move on from all of this and move on from it quickly.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that the British people, T.K., won’t move on from it quickly because this cost of living crisis that we’re talking about worldwide at the moment is dominating in the United Kingdom as well.</p>

<p>Interest rates are going to have to go higher.</p>

<p>Mortgage costs are getting more expensive and a cost of living time is going in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Real rates are moving up there.</p>

<p>And as we heard from Jordan, Rochester’s United Kingdom, just OUTFRONT of many other nations in the struggle.</p>

<p>I’m Bloomberg Radio.</p>

<p>We welcome you.</p>

<p>A shot of 10 Downing Street with a different podium than the trust podium, more stark, more corporate.</p>

<p>I will editorialize and off on the port side, rather, on the starboard side.</p>

<p>The right side of the door is Mr.</p>

<p>Su Keenan will come out.</p>

<p>Is Lawrence the cat with his back to the door? Because there’s a rumor.</p>

<p>Will Mr Sonic live at 10 Downing Street when you’re that fence? Well, there we go.</p>

<p>I guess that was in the Zeitlin.</p>

<p>How many prime ministers has got camp out left town in the last few years? Lazy.</p>

<p>Can I just come to you quickly before the prime minister walks out? What is the governor of the bank having to want to hear today? Don’t worry about the stability he’s been promised.</p>

<p>He wants to know who the chancellor is and when this when this budget is going to be.</p>

<p>And if he can confirm that it is Jeremy Hunt and it’s now October the 1st first as expected.</p>

<p>The markets that we have today and the governor, I’ll be happy.</p>

<p>Ultimately, he wants cooperation between the economic institutions of the UK.</p>

<p>And we heard from the chief economist Hugh Pelle earlier taking a veiled, thinly veiled swipe at the trusts administration for really undermining the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England.</p>

<p>You would hope that that’s going to end now with this administration.</p>

<p>Thirty seven minutes after the hour.</p>

<p>Futures at negative 12 and the VIX.</p>

<p>Hundred thirty is of note here.</p>

<p>Earnings coming out.</p>

<p>We’ll get to that in a moment.</p>

<p>Lizzie, I want to sneak this in.</p>

<p>If I can.</p>

<p>And very importantly, John will hopefully go to IRNA on time.</p>

<p>Prime minister here.</p>

<p>Lizzie, will he tour the country? Will he like King Charles after the funeral? Will he? Will he go to Wales? Will he go to those cities that were labor and became conservative? Will he go to Scotland? What does a new PM do? I’m sure he will in his constituency, don’t forget up north in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>I think he might be the first prime minister from a Yorkshire constituency.</p>

<p>Correct me if I’m wrong.</p>

<p>He obviously took over.</p>

<p>You’ll know this, Tom from William Hague.</p>

<p>But he’s going to need to strengthen the union, because this chaos in the Tory party has only given Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party, confidence.</p>

<p>And he’s also going to have to charm the red wall seats that put Boris Johnson into office with such a landslide.</p>

<p>At the moment, it looks like the Tories will be wiped off the electoral map when they come to a general election.</p>

<p>So his message has been unite or die.</p>

<p>He’s going to have to unite the country as well as the party.</p>

<p>Unspoken, John, is he’s a allowed he’s 40 some years old.</p>

<p>He’s the youngest prime minister from 1812.</p>

<p>It’s an impressive statesman way back.</p>

<p>He’s very close to talk to love.</p>

<p>He’s a he’s a kid.</p>

<p>I think only a few years younger than Tony Blair was when he became.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>But you look at the John Tucker, see that as American politics and 42 a show.</p>

<p>It’s like in Finland, in Estonia.</p>

<p>This is could be Speaker Pelosi’s child.</p>

<p>I’m with you.</p>

<p>It’s show.</p>

<p>Houses everywhere.</p>

<p>You went there, right? Did it.</p>

<p>Leslie, we talked a lot about this being a parliamentary democracy that the leader of the Conservative Party needs to be able to govern the party within parliament.</p>

<p>Lisa, let’s talk about the party membership of the Conservatives.</p>

<p>Is this their guy? No, we wouldn’t know Audrey, because it never got to that I’m sure many of the membership were annoyed about that.</p>

<p>It could have ended up being so divisive.</p>

<p>It didn’t have to go to the membership.</p>

<p>But I don’t think it’s wise to say that he would have lost Patty Lawton because perhaps the membership would have had buyer’s remorse after putting trust into number 10.</p>

<p>But I’m sure that the party MP is grateful that we didn’t have to go through the drama, the psychodrama of a leadership election put out to the membership yet again, because this is it.</p>

<p>I mean, I’ve just been stood here seven weeks ago.</p>

<p>You’ll forgive me if I’ve got a bit of deja vu.</p>

<p>It’s unbelievable to me that we’ve been doing this the way we have.</p>

<p>I’ve said a few times we’ve got a system to deal with it.</p>

<p>This is the system to deal with it.</p>

<p>I do wonder if the certain aspects of the policies announced by Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, who we expect to be the chancellor in the weeks and months to come.</p>

<p>Tom, certain aspects that you might have to revisit, the number one that I’m thinking of is the idea that you only offer support to offset the energy pain through to April of next year.</p>

<p>I just wondered, T.K., whether that’s something they have to revisit pretty early on if the crisis after energy supplies continues.</p>

<p>There’s this word that’s propped up, I’ll say Sunday, maybe Saturday, but austerity and the new definition of austerity and the fundamental thing, John, as you mentioned earlier, may be Lisa, you mentioned it.</p>

<p>It is austerity within a higher nominal rate regime.</p>

<p>People at home, they don’t care about fancy bow tie, real read stuff.</p>

<p>They’re looking at higher nominal rates across everything they do.</p>

<p>The former government, the former leader, to be specific, less trusts tried to do something different some and it failed.</p>

<p>Markets weeded out very, very quickly.</p>

<p>And I just want to see what the options are available for any government right now facing down a cost of living crisis, high inflation in places like the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>What they can actually do? How much fiscal space is there to help out the people of countries like the United Kingdom? I believe we’ve lost Lizzy Burdett has some numbers in Berkeley Street.</p>

<p>Let’s go to Lawrence CAC.</p>

<p>You think, Larry? You think Larry’s got something to say on that probe? Sure.</p>

<p>Well, she said it’s deja vu over.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the jar do the right? Oh, honestly, seeing this one a few times, we all have we are waiting for the British prime minister, Rishi, soon that when he walks out of that door, he will do so as the leader of the Conservative Party and of the leader of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>When those comments begin, we’ll bring those comments to you.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>

<p>We also need to talk about the earnings that are coming out.</p>

<p>And I will say, Ali DAX is something coming to talk about briefly, Adidas.</p>

<p>They have been silent for weeks on the relationship with Kenya West.</p>

<p>And finally this morning, they come out and Satish, they are terminating the partnership with Kenya.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>After the anti Semitic comments from him over the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Lisa, many people incredibly disappointed estate in this company this long to make this comment.</p>

<p>Wasn’t he responsible for about 8 percent of their sales or some something like that? And they’re saying that they’re going to take a write down.</p>

<p>The media fact is, two hundred and forty four forty six point five million dollar hit to net income in the current fiscal year.</p>

<p>You’re right.</p>

<p>It took them a long time because he’s pivotal to their sales.</p>

<p>At what point does this become, though, a deal breaker, given some of the recent shenanigans? Isn’t that disappointing, though, for companies that preach all of this stuff about diversity and inclusion? Do you get comments like that and they go silent for weeks because he’s key to their sales? Isn’t that absolutely ridiculous? Think about how many times companies want to distance themselves from certain individuals because they’ve done certain things, whether it’s drugs, steroids, performance enhancing drugs about to step away and then you get anti-Semitic comments by someone key to your company and you say nothing for weeks about it.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>Just to be completely transparent.</p>

<p>This was a discussion at the dinner table because there were certain members of the family who really like Konya West’s music.</p>

<p>And can they keep listening to it? And they had this whole debate trying to rationalize it.</p>

<p>And he just said, you know what? You either have a credo or you have some sort of ethic that you follow or you don’t.</p>

<p>And that’s the bottom line.</p>

<p>That stock is down by about 4 percent in the premarket somewhat.</p>

<p>It’s talk about GM as well.</p>

<p>General Motors, that quarter adjusted EPS 225 estimate 180 night revenue just a little bit lighter.</p>

<p>Nothing overly concerning in this going into a conversation and interviewed some with the leader of GM a little bit later in the next hour and 15 minutes or so.</p>

<p>She’ll be sitting down with Matt Miller Alix Steel.</p>

<p>It’s a beast of its own.</p>

<p>And I’m going to give a major shout out to my colleague over at Citigroup, which I think was way out front on this, the absolute mediocrity of GM and the surge that we saw up through the pandemic and frankly, a roll over to revisit the mediocrity of 2018.</p>

<p>The 10 year annual return that Mary Barra has had to be challenged by is five point zero six percent, five percent a year.</p>

<p>Shareholder return.</p>

<p>Can you rationalize that given an auto company granted pandemic.</p>

<p>Granted national issues.</p>

<p>Granted technology issues and the rest.</p>

<p>But you just wonder, when is it safe to say they get dramatic where they start developing free cash flow like some of the Europeans? That Germanic? Yeah, I mean, it’s like Mercedes or BMW and and the rest.</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p>But I just there’s always a spin here.</p>

<p>There’s always something new.</p>

<p>They’re mentioned and electric vehicles today, they’re going to increase production and they’re OK.</p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>Where’s the shareholder return? That’s what I just I’m looking for it at 5 percent per year.</p>

<p>You want the new excuse? Right now, 3M, 3M, the company sees full year adjusted EPS at ten dollars, 10 cents to 10, 35.</p>

<p>Previously they had seen 10, 30 to 10, 80.</p>

<p>What do they blame in drumroll, the uncertain macro environment and Rameau, the US dollar that we’ve got, that’s going to be the CAC.</p>

<p>But at some point there is some truth to this, right? I mean, the appreciation is pretty dramatic.</p>

<p>And how much are international companies from the U.S.</p>

<p>really going to suffer as a result? But this is the second downgrade to its outlook so far this year for 3M.</p>

<p>How many of these multinationals have to do that before there’s some sort of bigger sense? And how much really visibility do we have about how long this is going to continue for and really how much is has to do with the dollar? I mean, I can tell you’re somewhat skeptical, John, about whether no excuse for something else.</p>

<p>You know, drum roll.</p>

<p>Could it possibly be? I’m just saying, I’m not surprised.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>That’s all I’m saying.</p>

<p>I’m not surprised.</p>

<p>We’ll keep an eye on the earnings for you.</p>

<p>We understand the prime minister still not arrived at Number 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>When he gets them.</p>

<p>We have that address.</p>

<p>We’ll bring that to you.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>The prime minister running late for an audience with the king.</p>

<p>A little bit earlier this morning.</p>

<p>This is a new king.</p>

<p>And know I don’t I’m not privy to the short meetings of an ancient queen.</p>

<p>But you wonder if this is a new style of King Charles where there’s a substantial conversation.</p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p>I believe we’re following the now up the mountain from Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>So we’re not doing it.</p>

<p>You want to do that? Let’s to come back and listen.</p>

<p>Not acceptable.</p>

<p>I really don’t want to do this kind of thing.</p>

<p>So, you know, I’ll have.</p>

<p>This week it.</p>

<p>Going to be who was going to pick him up within the autumnal glow.</p>

<p>All right.</p>

<p>The lead in just a moment.</p>

<p>Lisa, though, goes past horse guards parade.</p>

<p>I can’t hold on to Westminster.</p>

<p>There’s this ceremony today.</p>

<p>It’s at Number 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>Tried to excuse.</p>

<p>It’s dumb.</p>

<p>I mean, I’ve been I’ve been living for this moment, Lisa, for 20 years.</p>

<p>Have you? It’s really as if everything has been built up to this.</p>

<p>Follow the car from the palace.</p>

<p>Do you love this guy? I mean, I know he married into a lot of money in that.</p>

<p>But how did he make his money? Was he a classic investment banker at Goldman? That kind of background, he came, you know.</p>

<p>You know, my design.</p>

<p>But he wasn’t like chief economist.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear.</p>

<p>He was a dealmaker.</p>

<p>Well, but this is the reason why it’s gonna be difficult for him to make some severe cuts to spending at a time of austerity given his own largesse.</p>

<p>I’m just wondering how that’s going.</p>

<p>I don’t buy into that.</p>

<p>But we’ve had we’ve had huge filthy rich people back centuries that have run things.</p>

<p>I mean, is it uncommon to have somebody being read and there’s loaded.</p>

<p>There’s levels of loaded.</p>

<p>But is it is.</p>

<p>So what? That he’s that wealthy and whose families are wealthy? Looks like they just come past Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>So would you want him to stop at Greggs? I thought we went to this pick pick up some guy.</p>

<p>That’s when the prime minister actually arrives at Number 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>Bring those comments to you.</p>

<p>Take you in to carry on following the car.</p>

<p>Well, I think we’re done.</p>

<p>I don’t think we have a choice.</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>

<p>Maybe their views of the buses are stopping, of course, here.</p>

<p>They they promenade back to 10 Downing Street, where Lizzie BURDEN is.</p>

<p>I want to get back to earnings in to say the tech earnings today.</p>

<p>And I think, Lisa, you mentioned this in your brief.</p>

<p>Google is the real first look at the future of digital advertising, which is a growing part of Amazon’s business.</p>

<p>And of course, there’s others out there.</p>

<p>And my problem is we conflate Google and was SNAP.</p>

<p>We can play Google and with Facebook.</p>

<p>And I just think that’s off the mark and then get a little look at Microsoft after the close as well.</p>

<p>So very important.</p>

<p>Big names then on to Thursday keeps open about Thursday.</p>

<p>First ISE huge.</p>

<p>You want to talk about tech.</p>

<p>Did you see the tech names in China yesterday? Absolutely hammered.</p>

<p>Alabama by T.J.</p>

<p>Dell at one point yesterday were all down about 20 percent.</p>

<p>I did a fancy chart of Alibaba and the plunged is the right word, John.</p>

<p>But back to a long term support line of where they’ve been for years that they go through to a crisis low.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>But they’re certainly back to a support that speaks ill of the equity markets and the trust in the new regime.</p>

<p>Let’s touch base with undercurrent on some of this, the Bloomberg chief Asia economic correspondent.</p>

<p>And we saw the events over the weekend.</p>

<p>We saw the fallout in this market.</p>

<p>And let me tell you, when the affects market ended, it continues.</p>

<p>Yeah, it does continue, at least with the currency, say you can point to fundamentals there, John.</p>

<p>The sell off in yuan was delayed.</p>

<p>It’s not clear that the authorities are allowing it to weaken.</p>

<p>We’re seeing it go back to levels both onshore and onshore.</p>

<p>We haven’t seen in some cases at all.</p>

<p>In fact, now that does, of course, affect the strong U.S.</p>

<p>dollar, but it does reflect what’s going on in China.</p>

<p>Sentiment is very negative and turning even more negative post Congress.</p>

<p>There’s no sign of a pivot on Covid zero.</p>

<p>No sign of a pivot on the real estate story either.</p>

<p>So that’s what’s happening in the equity stories.</p>

<p>I got to jump in.</p>

<p>The prime minister of the United Kingdom, Richie, soon act addressing the British people.</p>

<p>Let’s take a listen.</p>

<p>I’ve just been to Buckingham Palace and accepted His Majesty the King’s invitation to form a government in his name.</p>

<p>It is only right to explain why I’m standing here as your new prime minister.</p>

<p>Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis.</p>

<p>The aftermath of Covid still lingers.</p>

<p>Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains.</p>

<p>The world over.</p>

<p>I want to pay tribute to my predecessor, Liz Truss.</p>

<p>She was not wrong to want to improve growth in this country.</p>

<p>It is a noble aim, and I admired her restlessness to create change, but some mistakes were made not born of ill will or bad intentions.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite, in fact.</p>

<p>But mistakes nonetheless.</p>

<p>And I have been elected as leader of my party and your prime minister in part to fix them.</p>

<p>And that work begins immediately.</p>

<p>I will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government’s agenda.</p>

<p>This will mean difficult decisions to come.</p>

<p>But you saw me during Covid doing everything I could to protect people and businesses with schemes like furlough.</p>

<p>There are always limits.</p>

<p>More so now than ever.</p>

<p>But I promise you this I will bring that same compassion to the challenges we face today.</p>

<p>The government I lead will not leave the next generation, your children and grandchildren with a debt to settle.</p>

<p>That we were too weak to pay ourselves.</p>

<p>I will unite our country not with words, but with action.</p>

<p>I will work day in and day out to deliver for you.</p>

<p>This government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level.</p>

<p>Trust is earned and I will earn yours.</p>

<p>I will always be grateful to Boris Johnson for his incredible achievements as prime minister.</p>

<p>And I treasure his warmth and generosity of spirit.</p>

<p>And I know he would agree that the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual.</p>

<p>It is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us.</p>

<p>And the heart of that mandate is our manifesto.</p>

<p>I will deliver on its promise a stronger NHS, better schools, safer streets, control of our borders, protecting our environment, supporting our armed forces, levelling up and building an economy that embraces the opportunities of Brexit, where businesses invest, innovate and create jobs.</p>

<p>I understand how difficult this moment is.</p>

<p>After the billions of pounds, it cost us to combat Covid after all the dislocation that caused in the midst of a terrible war that must be seen successfully to its conclusions.</p>

<p>I fully appreciate how hard things are, and I understand too that I have work to do to restore trust.</p>

<p>After all, that has happened.</p>

<p>All I can say is that I am not daunted.</p>

<p>I know the high office.</p>

<p>I have accepted and I hope to live up to its demands.</p>

<p>But when the opportunity to serve comes along, you cannot question the moment, only your willingness.</p>

<p>So I stand here before you ready to lead our country into the future.</p>

<p>To put your needs above politics.</p>

<p>To reach out and build a government that represents the very best traditions of my party.</p>

<p>Together we can achieve incredible things.</p>

<p>We will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have made and fill tomorrow and every day thereafter with hope.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Rishi Su Keenan, British prime minister there the message, pretty simple, difficult decisions to come for the UK economy.</p>

<p>Mistakes have been made.</p>

<p>I’m here to fix them from New York City for our audience worldwide on TV and radio.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Some Jonathan Ferro NIKKEI.</p>

<p>Pretty blunt to the point that tough decisions to come Dani Burger carefully worded.</p>

<p>I thought, you know, moving from the past to the very recent present, Twitter lit up as some of these phrases were mentioned.</p>

<p>But I do think, John, from many people, this is the first time they’ve heard the prime minister speak working to restore trust, Lisa, quote.</p>

<p>After all that has happened, trying to ride out some of the goodwill that he built over the Covid era and how much they did to extend some of the aid to individuals and including the furlough program.</p>

<p>How far does that get this administration at a time of potential austerity in the face of higher heating bills and just all in higher cost? He didn’t use the word austerity.</p>

<p>The message, isn’t it? We will not leave it to the next generation with debt to Satya Nadella.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Lisa, they’re going to go hard Jonathan Ferro.</p>

<p>And this is the difficult thing.</p>

<p>How do you effect an economy in optimism at a time when that’s going to mean some serious declines in the economic output of this nation? Some people talking about this as the world’s sixth biggest economy.</p>

<p>For now, we have heard that from economists were how delayed do you project a feeling of strength into the future? Less about an outside number, 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>Let’s head over to Lizzie.</p>

<p>Now, Lizzie, you’ve followed that address by the British prime minister.</p>

<p>It went on for several minutes or so.</p>

<p>Talk to us about the reaction in the U.K.</p>

<p>so far.</p>

<p>Well, the reaction behind the black doll was raucous applause, really? I was trying to push hard on the reset button that he did pay tribute to Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, but brutally, very clearly.</p>

<p>He said that trust under trust.</p>

<p>Mistakes were made.</p>

<p>And he also took a swipe at Boris Johnson, saying that now is the time for professionalism, accountability, integrity.</p>

<p>But he still needs to draw that thread of continuity between himself and Boris Johnson because he is riding on Johnson’s Monday here.</p>

<p>And that’s why he’s underscored his commitment to the manifesto from 2019.</p>

<p>He was referring to Brexit levelling up the National Health Service.</p>

<p>All the pledges that he needs to deliver on if he wants to be elected by the electorate in two years time, January 2025 at the latest.</p>

<p>But ultimately, as you say, is a realistic message.</p>

<p>That’s the message that he was trying to deliver throughout his leadership campaign in the summer.</p>

<p>This was kind of his moment to say, I told you so.</p>

<p>He resisted the temptation until he’s been stood in front of that black door.</p>

<p>He didn’t say it well to us.</p>

<p>Atomics was imploding.</p>

<p>But now, yeah, he’s going to have to make some really, really tough decisions and harder yet because of the damage trust trust bequeathed him.</p>

<p>Leslie, how important is it for issues to now not to be speaking to fellow employees, but to the general population? For example, in two years time to actually see some programs through after such tumult out with three prime ministers so far this year? Well, yeah, he’s got a big job on his hands.</p>

<p>He needs to unite the party, but also the country.</p>

<p>And that goes hand-in-hand with steering Britain out of this economic crisis, because, as you say, he’s going to have to choose between tax rises and spending cuts.</p>

<p>And if he goes too hard on the tax rises, he’s going to alienate the Tory right.</p>

<p>And they’ve put him in to number 10.</p>

<p>So it’s very difficult.</p>

<p>And as you say as well, he’s going to have to appear he’s going to have to convince the public that he’s genuinely empathetic of that situation.</p>

<p>When he’s the word that is overwhelmingly associated with vicious eunuch surveys show is not that he’s the youngest prime minister in over 200 years or that he’s the first British Asian in office.</p>

<p>Is the fact that he’s rich.</p>

<p>And I think that is interesting when you contrast that with American politics, where that seemed to serve Donald Trump well, it was almost giving him credibility Alisyn.</p>

<p>Wonderful to hear from you, Lucy Burton.</p>

<p>Outside number 10 Downing Street, minutes after hearing from the British prime minister really soon.</p>

<p>The message, the headline.</p>

<p>Difficult decisions to come from New York.</p>

<p>Let’s wait for the price action for you on the S&amp;P 500 slightly negative.</p>

<p>We’re down a quarter of one per cent on the S&amp;P with a big DAX earnings.</p>

<p>Still to come.</p>

<p>Futures are negative just a little bit.</p>

<p>Yields are lower by 7 basis points 417 32 and the earnings keep coming through.</p>

<p>And I can tell you, Coca-Cola out just moments ago, raising their full year guidance, full year adjusted organic revenue.</p>

<p>Now looking at plus 14 percent to plus 15 per cent on the estimate had been positive, thirteen point four percent.</p>

<p>Better numbers from Kodak moments ago nailed it.</p>

<p>And this has to do with pricing persistency.</p>

<p>Can you raise prices into inflation? Julian Emanuel has modelled eight point eight percent revenue lift.</p>

<p>And here’s Coke just as a quick.</p>

<p>Blush, John, I meant to say leading the way a revenue beat a well, organic revenue up 16 per cent, the estimate, Lisa.</p>

<p>Nine point eight one.</p>

<p>And that’s even including a five to six percent currency headwind.</p>

<p>So it wasn’t an excuse even though they did a nod to it, which is sort of your question of it’s one thing to blame the effects issue.</p>

<p>It’s another to say that’s the reason for the disappointment.</p>

<p>Reaffirming your outlook is as good as a beat these days.</p>

<p>I would suggest GM did that as well about 15, 20 minutes ago.</p>

<p>Leaks from a catch of the CEO in about an hour from now.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s one of the things that are going to be watching to to whip through some of the other things that we’re looking at today.</p>

<p>We got a slew of economic data, including August, U.S., FHA, FAA, a house price index, as well as the S&amp;P CoreLogic 20 City Index.</p>

<p>How much do you start to see those prices roll over? And what’s the lead time really into the core CPI measures that we look at? 1 p.m., the U.S.</p>

<p>is selling 42 billion dollars of two year notes.</p>

<p>Who shows up for these bond auctions? It looks attractive for some.</p>

<p>And others say perhaps it has to go five higher for looking at a 5 percent Fed funds rate for a year or more.</p>

<p>And today, the earnings do continue after the bell.</p>

<p>We are sort of drum beating to Microsoft and Alphabet, given that those account for such a huge proportion of the overall index.</p>

<p>And Microsoft, I believe, John, is expected to come in with the lowest sales increase going back to 2017.</p>

<p>So how much does that really give a guide for where we are right now? A couple of names.</p>

<p>So we’ll have something to say about foreign exchange up short stuff a little bit later this afternoon.</p>

<p>Then the big names like Apple coming up on New Year’s Day.</p>

<p>I think it’s like 2, 3 percent as sort of the typical average model.</p>

<p>And we’re clearly out over there for even 6 percent.</p>

<p>You may have a few that are 7 or 8 percent substantial.</p>

<p>We get lucky this morning.</p>

<p>Jump out around a table with us, the head of the BlackRock Investment Institute and formerly so much more than that.</p>

<p>John, fantastic to catch up with you, sir.</p>

<p>I read the weekly note from the BlackRock Investment Institute that came out just yesterday.</p>

<p>And you talked about the significance of the midterms.</p>

<p>And you guys don’t think they’re that significant in the future returns over the next several months.</p>

<p>Why? First of all, it’s so great to be here.</p>

<p>You know, we think the usual playbook for the midterm is that, you know, if you have divide guard, divided government or a house, as it tends to be a boost for markets.</p>

<p>But as anything else this time around them and usual playbooks don’t apply.</p>

<p>We think the main stories about their foretold recession that we’re going to have we believe in in the current in the next year.</p>

<p>And as a result, we think that this is the second sideshow.</p>

<p>The important for the future of the country in everything.</p>

<p>But in terms of markets, we don’t think that’s an important driver.</p>

<p>Swap lines, front, center or major discussion at the meetings in Washington here a week or so ago.</p>

<p>Give us BlackRock estimate of how countries will have to go to the Fed given the global power shortage, the liquidity that are out there is seen in FRB or the US.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>You know, the important thing is here we are.</p>

<p>We’re seeing the most rapid tightening of financial conditions in a in a generation in a very long time.</p>

<p>We haven’t seen really the cracks yet appear on the system.</p>

<p>It’s remarkable to see all of the strengthening of the U.S.</p>

<p>dollar you’ve seen.</p>

<p>We’re not like the knock on a thing or cracks where we have seen under circumstances.</p>

<p>I think that creates a level of anxiety that was really clear at the IMF.</p>

<p>A lot of conversation about how we shore up the system in that context, swap line will be a will be a key key tool potentially in that environment.</p>

<p>But I think so far what is really surprising is that, you know, it’s been very stable despite despite what we’ve done all your academics at Princeton and your work with the Bank of Canada.</p>

<p>If we believe it’s non-linear, is we disinflation? Do you think we can succeed? That was stability or they’re going to be instabilities witness with Damian.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>As today we looked at a Colombia piece going from ninety eight down to sixty three and a price of bun.</p>

<p>That’s a crack.</p>

<p>I think it’s very hard to see something that’s going to be a smooth landing in any way.</p>

<p>That’s true for the economy.</p>

<p>That’s true for the financial market in this context.</p>

<p>That’s why, you know, we think we’re not a clear path towards over a tightening of monetary policy, but it’s going to be very rocky.</p>

<p>We’re underweight equities, you know, as bearish as we’ve ever been, I guess, in terms of broad risk taking in this moment at some point is going to change.</p>

<p>But the reason is really because that tightening is it could be non-linear, as you say.</p>

<p>And we haven’t seen Manus Cranny.</p>

<p>I think the U.K.</p>

<p>we’ve seen over the last month is like an accelerated peak in the future.</p>

<p>And I think that’s that’s what we need to guard against.</p>

<p>John, if you believe in a hard landing, why not buy treasuries here? Huh? That’s a that’s a great question, and that’s another aspect of the current environment where the playbook, the typical playbook might not be applying.</p>

<p>We don’t think is going to apply.</p>

<p>We are going to see a recession, but it’s gonna be a recession.</p>

<p>The context where inflation is going to be under control and it’s a foretold recession.</p>

<p>It’s really the recession caused by monetary policy readied as a way by which inflation will get under control.</p>

<p>And as a result, when we get to that recession, you won’t see the typical reaction of yields falling and bonds playing the safety role.</p>

<p>So the typical playbook of go find refuge in bonds in this recession, I think won’t apply.</p>

<p>This part of the reason why perhaps the stability that you talked about, the surprising resilience of markets is almost a headwind to them because it won’t necessarily stop the rising rate environment.</p>

<p>It won’t necessarily change where we are in a wholesale value.</p>

<p>How high can yields go and stay for a prolonged period of time before something breaks in the financial system? So in our estimates, like if we go to 5 percent as now, we kind of assume for early next year, this is a world where we’re going to see a very significant slowdown of activity, decline activities 2 percent.</p>

<p>We think as a minimum of GDP, it’s 3 million jobs that will need to be lost in that context.</p>

<p>So in the world where 5 percent is sustained and I think in the world like this, the financial system leverage as it as it is, we’ll start to see some some response.</p>

<p>And that’s the.</p>

<p>So 5 percent is is where we’re heading.</p>

<p>We don’t think we can go much further than that.</p>

<p>That’s why over the course of the first half of next year, we’re going to see central banks having forced into some stopping pause before they can go further.</p>

<p>John, you said recession foretold.</p>

<p>I’m interested by that phrase.</p>

<p>You’ve also talked about the appropriate time horizon to bring inflation back to Target.</p>

<p>And I think you’ve explained conveyed your disappointment that central banks aren’t having that discussion a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Does it have to be this way? I think what is very interesting in the U.N.</p>

<p>and we we’ve written about this is the fact that, you know, there’s years used to be two sides to any decision in central banking.</p>

<p>Like it’s not typically obvious what you have to do.</p>

<p>And I think this enviroment is as tricky as it has ever been.</p>

<p>I mean, I don’t think there’s been any short, sharp tradeoff that we have to deal with.</p>

<p>You know, we have to go back to 70s.</p>

<p>And the 70s was a different situation altogether.</p>

<p>There’s a tendency to apply to apply the playbook of the 70s, but we’re not in the 70s.</p>

<p>And so this lack of two sided debate on what’s going to happen or nuance is troubling.</p>

<p>And that’s why we think that we are going to get over tightening.</p>

<p>That’s honestly the outcome that ought to be.</p>

<p>But I think it’s happening at some point, think that the pressure to force it will be pretty, pretty strong.</p>

<p>And we’ve seen that in the U.K., right.</p>

<p>I mean, we’ve seen the Senate version.</p>

<p>You go in one direction.</p>

<p>Markets will put some pressure and I think we’ll see some force pause.</p>

<p>That’s not great for credibility.</p>

<p>I think it’s better for central banks to be on the front foot.</p>

<p>And, you know, I’ve signaled that there are some nuances here we might need to deal with, but this is not the situation we’re in.</p>

<p>So I think we’re gonna be forced into, you know, a wake up call.</p>

<p>And and we’ll look at a pause, but one that has been forced as opposed to being quickly here.</p>

<p>And I could go for an hour with you on this.</p>

<p>There was a guy named Bernanke who e-mailed you when you were a kid and said, do you want to try for a speech at Princeton? You talked about it the day he won the Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>What did he and Anna Schwartz and Milton Friedman do? So we didn’t repeat a depression.</p>

<p>Well, I think the key lesson of the Great Depression that Anna Schwartz and Friedman at first, like more from an anecdotal perspective or documenting that the depression was.</p>

<p>And that Ben Bernanke and others have a more formalized was that if you tighten monetary policy as the economy is is is going down, you create this financial accelerator dynamic to the banking systems that we’re doing right now and with and with bank runs.</p>

<p>And I think that was very much in his mind when 2000 came out.</p>

<p>It was interesting in the speech he gave in 2002 in the anniversary of Friedman that he said, we heard you won’t do it again.</p>

<p>That was that was a reference to the Depression.</p>

<p>He thought he was abusing his status at the time, but not his future status.</p>

<p>He was he was he was a governor, but became chairman afterwards.</p>

<p>The thing, though, is that this time I don’t think this is the playbook.</p>

<p>This is not the playbook for the current situation.</p>

<p>This is not a demand driven financial crisis bank run story.</p>

<p>This is a massive supply shock that we’re dealing through.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that those lessons apply right now.</p>

<p>So that was, what, 2008 and the city for 20 20 and after the jump by van of BlackRock jump.</p>

<p>Fantastic to have you with us in the studio in New York.</p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>And we’re still trying to unwind some of those policies from the Bernanke.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>It’s amazing to see the ECB came out and had to basically come up with this new tool, TPA, that we had.</p>

<p>The Bank of England had to step into the gilt market.</p>

<p>We’ve had to be OJD that’s had to intervene in our facts in South Korea.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, some also had to do something on the credit side.</p>

<p>The government had to announce, make an announcement that said when I just want that t CAC.</p>

<p>We tried to step back from this era.</p>

<p>How many more times central banks will have to step back in? They’re going to be very subtle.</p>

<p>And you go from Damian says sorry yesterday to John Bell today in its extremely fluid right now.</p>

<p>John and I frankly think the original theories don’t work.</p>

<p>Here’s doctor events as it’s a supply shock.</p>

<p>Shock.</p>

<p>Would you like to be a central banker again? Do you fancy that? Not really.</p>

<p>No, I think the Montreal Canadiens didn’t think so.</p>

<p>Leave that to others.</p>

<p>Well, coming up on this program, Mary Barra, the chairman and CEO of General Motors, looking forward to that.</p>

<p>Matt Miller going to catch up with her in about an hour from now from New York this morning.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>Well, this is pulling back.</p>

<p>Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Mateo in the UK.</p>

<p>Ricci Sue CAC has formally become prime minister.</p>

<p>Snake addressed the nation outside Number 10 Downing Street after meeting with King Charles a third.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Don’t take a pause at one point.</p>

<p>Conditions around the road tell you it’s rational to take a pause because any three months doesn’t matter much.</p>

<p>Hello from New York.</p>

<p>To monitor the price action, looks like this going into the open.</p>

<p>Empowered equity futures slightly negative through much of this morning.</p>

<p>We stay that we’re down a third of 1 percent.</p>

<p>Yields are lower by 7 basis points on a 10 year, 417 32.</p>

<p>Any affects market.</p>

<p>Euro dollar, slightly weaker.</p>

<p>Euro in the mix here, negative zero point once six per cent on that currency pound 98, 58.</p>

<p>I can tell you the Italian prime minister used her first speech this morning, guys, to lawmakers in Italy to absolutely slam the ECB.</p>

<p>How much of this are we going to see across Europe and across the United States? It’s a mystery.</p>

<p>We don’t know if the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>We’ve seen it from Senator Sanders and Senator Warren.</p>

<p>You imagine we’ll see a whole lot more if the economy starts to roll over and unemployment in the elections as well.</p>

<p>And this is what Prime Minister Maloney had to say to the decision to raise borrowing costs, quote, is considered by many to be a rash choice, which runs the risk of impacting banking credit to families and businesses.</p>

<p>And Lisa, she went on and she went on Emma Chandra.</p>

<p>And how much of this is driven by that anger that austerity was really placed on Italy, was placed on Greece, was placed on some of these nations by the ECB, by the European region at a time when Germany is kind of front running some of this these issues.</p>

<p>I mean, how much is that part of what’s fueling some of the additional anger toward these policies? T.K., we’re going to see a lot more of this.</p>

<p>I think I think it’s fair to say and again, a chart is not my chart of the year, but close here is the measurement of the Bloomberg financial conditions in Europe is an absolute outlier.</p>

<p>Can’t say enough how restrictive their stances.</p>

<p>Given the mathematics and comments here on bond buying as well.</p>

<p>Here’s the quote for you that is compounded by the decision already made by the central bank to end beginning on July 122.</p>

<p>The program to buy back bonds on the open market, which creates further difficulties for member states that have elevated public debt.</p>

<p>Well, we will see.</p>

<p>And of course, through Thursday’s ECB, wrote Jihye Lee, it is very lucky for 75 from the ECB.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Oh, he’s an easy 75.</p>

<p>Then what? After that? After that is after the midterm elections.</p>

<p>Annmarie Horden joins us again, our Bloomberg Washington correspondent Amery at the White House.</p>

<p>And I guess the basic ideas of president yesterday giving pep talks and that what does the president of the United States do in the next two weeks? What he’s gonna doing is gonna do his best to try to rally Democrats to get out and vote.</p>

<p>Try to rally independents to make sure they’re reaching out as well to the youth vote, which was critical in the presidential election.</p>

<p>But also, Tom, you have to think he will only go campaign, of course, if those candidates want him alongside him.</p>

<p>You have very different views from some of these candidates that are really running in some of these tight races and critical races like John Fetterman in Pennsylvania has really embraced President Biden.</p>

<p>But then, of course, you have the Democratic Senate candidate in Ohio that has wanted to keep a very large wide distance from the president, actually looking at outreach to other members of his party, like Senator Manchin.</p>

<p>So the president is obviously going to walk that line.</p>

<p>But he’s going to continue to tout.</p>

<p>And he said this a few times yesterday, that the Democrats are fiscally responsible and that the Republicans want to do are mega, mega trickle down.</p>

<p>This is a line that he continues to say and I imagine the next 14 days that will only ramp up.</p>

<p>It goes to the apathy we talked about in the last hour.</p>

<p>What does the turnout look right now? I mean, I’m going to editorialize in the presidential election.</p>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Trump got more votes and he got the last time around.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, there was this huge turnout for President Biden.</p>

<p>Do you expect the same kind of dynamics again? Well, midterms obviously have less of a turnout in presidential elections.</p>

<p>But at the same time, you do have really important issues that are coming up on every single poll that may force people to want to get out to vote.</p>

<p>And obviously, that is going to be the economy.</p>

<p>That is inflation.</p>

<p>We don’t know what turnout will end up being until the very end.</p>

<p>Tom, you made a great point the last hour that do people even trust the polls? What we saw from the presidential election with former President Don Trump and then, of course, candidate Hillary Clinton, that the polls really got that wrong.</p>

<p>A lot of this has to do with the fact that there is potentially a bias that Democrats are more honest in polls and some Republicans actually shy away.</p>

<p>But we already have voting underway and there should be a robust turnout.</p>

<p>A lot of that also depends on a state of play of that election day.</p>

<p>The weather and things like that can affect whether or not people are going to go out and actually vote.</p>

<p>Enraged John’s point earlier, how much is a Federal Reserve becoming part of the electoral conversation in terms of them going too fast, too far and torpedoing the economy? I think for us in the financial markets and the individuals we talked to, it’s incredibly important, I think, for everyday Americans.</p>

<p>It’s not so much the Fed, but what the Fed is doing that is impacting their everyday lives.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for their mortgage rates? Is it actually taming inflation, having an impact on energy prices, a potential other prices going up, consumer prices like groceries and rent, but also the fact that does this mean if they’re going too fast, are they going to be blaming the Fed or like many do, blame the current administration? If we do end up in a recession, which if you look at Bloomberg Economics latest projections, it is one hundred percent.</p>

<p>It is basically we will be in a recession effectively at some point the next twelve months.</p>

<p>Dan RTS, Emory, thank you.</p>

<p>We basically heard that from jump out five months ago as BlackRock on this program in the shower.</p>

<p>It was 15 minutes, got some it basically said the same thing about next year.</p>

<p>The recession is already baked it.</p>

<p>That’s what you gonna get.</p>

<p>Or at least a slowdown.</p>

<p>Do we need a recession? I mean, I I’ve always been in the camp, John.</p>

<p>If you have 1 percent GDP, that’s not good enough for a huge body of Americans.</p>

<p>I don’t need an NBER recession.</p>

<p>What I have here is, is Dr.</p>

<p>BOVESPA mentioned is a massively restrictive set of central banks guessing due an economic slowdown.</p>

<p>This is they go to engineer the slowdown.</p>

<p>Isn’t that the problem, politically speaking, to Lisa’s question, to produce up to debt? I mean, the Columbia yesterday, I’m looking at the 10 year United Kingdom piece here now.</p>

<p>And it’s basically it’s basically back 13 years.</p>

<p>I mean, it’s a it’s a whole it’s Disney.</p>

<p>It’s a whole new world.</p>

<p>They said there’s been some some big losses in this market pick up on the destiny and the fairy tales.</p>

<p>It’s been out of someone in the markets for a long, long time.</p>

<p>And we’re trying to step back from that.</p>

<p>It comes with pain.</p>

<p>Well, and this to your point, Tom, you said that there’s so much pain in the bond market and yet jump over is not buying treasuries yet.</p>

<p>He sees yields going even higher because we still have it’s inflationary when it finished 5 percent.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s a little fun.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Citigroup to Anderson Harsh.</p>

<p>Just put this out, saying that home price data is going to show you do see a decline in housing prices.</p>

<p>But the wage data that we get in Friday could show upward pressure on inflation from wages indicating that wage spiral.</p>

<p>So this is the sort of push pull of where we are in inflation right now.</p>

<p>Can you make the argument that we’ve priced in the bulk of the rate hike cycle? If you look at pricing at 5 percent, then of course, you can probably make that argument.</p>

<p>Can you make the argument with pricing the consequences if that rate hike cycle? Tom, I don’t think anyone’s making the argument right now.</p>

<p>We’re also going to do a large recession.</p>

<p>Losses while we’re talking nowhere and nowhere else.</p>

<p>Yet the only in the world, six or seven standard deviation.</p>

<p>How that’s possible on UK, you.</p>

<p>Just ignore your colleagues.</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>I ignore him.</p>

<p>Complete just job shots at Rishaad Salamat has a six standard deviation ten year give.</p>

<p>You told him that? I told him that.</p>

<p>Live from New York City is the price action this Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>Good morning to you.</p>

<p>Futures negative a little more than a tenth of 1 percent.</p>

<p>No drama on the S&amp;P, on the NASDAQ, almost unchanged, positive by about a tenth of 1 percent after the close.</p>

<p>Later close to 18 percent called it about 18 percent of the Nasdaq 100 reporting in just two names.</p>

<p>Microsoft being one, Alphabet being the other will look out for that a little bit late.</p>

<p>So go to the close in the bond market.</p>

<p>So tense and 30, some say come with it.</p>

<p>Iconic Google, too.</p>

<p>I have no idea why I just called alphabet.</p>

<p>Towns and cities look like this in the bond market.</p>

<p>Your yield on a two year full.</p>

<p>Forty five.</p>

<p>Fifty six back on Friday.</p>

<p>We had a little look at 460 and then we backed away.</p>

<p>Backed away on some of the Fed speak.</p>

<p>The idea that we get this stepped down from seventy five days to twenty five.</p>

<p>We heard from Jordan, Rochester, Nomura.</p>

<p>He’s not looking for that step down.</p>

<p>No more.</p>

<p>And the team looking for 75 basis points for the Federal Reserve, this meeting and 75 basis points from the Federal Reserve at the next meeting.</p>

<p>One other thing Nomura and Jordan Rochester had to say was that the moment for him, certain currency pairs are getting a little bit boring and boring.</p>

<p>It’s welcome.</p>

<p>When you’re talking about Sterling Capel is where we say a little bit of outperformance.</p>

<p>The pound against the US dollar within 10 today, the pound right now at about 113, 25 and some.</p>

<p>I think we’re all hoping we get boring good quickly in the gilt market after we saw a move of more than 30 basis points lower at the front end of the yield curve.</p>

<p>Yesterday on Tuesday, the biggest one day move lower in about 30 years.</p>

<p>For governor, barely, John, it has improved, but the needles barely moved.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear.</p>

<p>The prime minister and his team understand those Bloomberg Markets.</p>

<p>We’ve got to be sure that the prime minister has a Bloomberg terminal at 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>What he’s got is five, six, even seven standard deviation moves.</p>

<p>And that’s untenable.</p>

<p>He’s got to fix that.</p>

<p>And we’ve got to work out his chance to it’s going to be we assume it’s going to be Jeremy Hunt.</p>

<p>Got to fill out that cap.</p>

<p>That’s true.</p>

<p>He’s got to work out what the budget looks like.</p>

<p>And then for Governor Bailey, it’s over to the governor, right? The Bank of England.</p>

<p>Does he need to do a whole lot more than he had to the last time they met? And does he need to do less than he had to do maybe in about two weeks ago? Tom, a lot’s changed in the U.K.</p>

<p>in the last several weeks, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Year to year in the U.K., about three thirty nine.</p>

<p>That’s the cross asset price action.</p>

<p>It’s got some single names we can do that with.</p>

<p>Lisa.</p>

<p>Lisa? Hey, John is affirming full year guidance.</p>

<p>The new beating of estimates.</p>

<p>That’s really the question that I have after some of the morning’s earnings.</p>

<p>We got U.P.S., forget General Motors, but with a firming up full year guidance.</p>

<p>Those stocks both popping more than 4 percent, nearly 5 percent for General Motors, four and a half percent for U.P.S..</p>

<p>How much have analysts had traders downgraded some of their expectations? And Tom, you were talking about that.</p>

<p>They’re basically affirming or just making estimates is basically akin to beating in an environment like the one that we’re currently in.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s you.</p>

<p>These are challenging stories.</p>

<p>U.P.S., I’m not going to conflate their 3M and GM, but they’re managing the message list every 90 days.</p>

<p>And what our viewers and listeners do as you look at shareholder return, which has been a challenge.</p>

<p>U.P.S. different than FedEx has actually provided much more negative guidance.</p>

<p>3M, however, the second downgrade in terms of full year forecast based on F X headwinds, second downgrade this year, that is not really being received particularly well in the market, down two point four percent per ton.</p>

<p>This really speaks to what we’ve seen more generally since the earnings have forgotten, which is that misses are pondering and just affirming is beating.</p>

<p>And, you know, beats aren’t necessarily being rewarded if they don’t have any visibility that far into the future.</p>

<p>Thank you, Lisa.</p>

<p>Right now, good visibility on foreign exchange.</p>

<p>Joining us was really sharp knowledge, particularly one on your end today, George Servos, global head of VFX research at Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>George, I’m going to pivot on you.</p>

<p>There’s six ways to go here.</p>

<p>I go to go to Thursday and the ECB meeting.</p>

<p>What will President Legarde do to the euro off of her decision to lift a presumed 75 beeps? Good morning, Tom.</p>

<p>So I think the answer is probably not much.</p>

<p>The 75 basis points hike is widely discounted.</p>

<p>It’s as you expected.</p>

<p>But critically, if you look at what’s been going on this year, currencies have not really been very correlated to interest rate differentials.</p>

<p>It’s been a lot more about the dollar.</p>

<p>Safe haven, risk premium.</p>

<p>Some of the very large geopolitical risks, whether in Russia or China.</p>

<p>So I wouldn’t really expect the ECB to have a sustained impact on the euro, which is something it has struggled to have for the last few meetings as well.</p>

<p>George, I they stop the growth outlook when it comes to Europe.</p>

<p>Just how fast do you and the team expect things to get in Europe and how quickly? Well, it’s interesting you mentioned the growth outlook, John, because if you look at the euro, it really behaves as a pro cyclical currency.</p>

<p>So for the euro to be strengthening, you need growth expectations to be bottoming out and then recovering.</p>

<p>I don’t think we’re at that stage yet.</p>

<p>We obviously got the PMI is just a few days ago with another downside surprise.</p>

<p>So we do have a recession in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>I suspect it may not be as bad as some of the more extreme forecasts that are out there, because so far at least, the weather has been quite favorable.</p>

<p>So if you’re looking at the nat gas situation, the tension that seems to be easing.</p>

<p>But no question about it.</p>

<p>Europe is going through a sharp slowdown and that is definitely a big headwind for the euro.</p>

<p>George, given the developing trade dynamics, the structural shift in the way the energy is supplied towards Europe, do you see some kind of structurally weaker euro in the years to come relative to what we saw in the year before? I think you can make the argument.</p>

<p>The problem is it’s impossible to fully understand where the equilibrium level of energy prices are.</p>

<p>If you take natural gas as an example, back in August, we were essentially three times as high.</p>

<p>If you plug in the energy prices at the moment in terms of what it means for the external accounts, the deficit is going to be half where it was in terms of peak.</p>

<p>So I think there’s still huge uncertainty in terms of the equilibrium level of oil and more importantly, not gas prices.</p>

<p>But if they stay as elevated or go back to where they were during the September period, we would be talking about a structurally weaker level of the euro for sure, other to build on, which I’m saying we’ve seen a lot of turmoil in China as well.</p>

<p>And China has a bigger play on the German economy, the biggest economy in the euro region.</p>

<p>And we’re seeing foreign flows just flood out of that nation now at a record pace.</p>

<p>How much does that feed into this feeling that structurally the euro will be weaker and that this will lead to weaker growth in your region now and in three years from now? Well, it’s interesting that you mentioned China, because if you look at the renminbi, it’s now actually weaken more than the euro has over the course of a year, and this is without facing a war in the footsteps, so to speak, or as big of a negative commodity shock.</p>

<p>So the main point I’d make on exchange rates is the dominant driver has very much been the broad dollar, which has pushed currencies weaker relative symmetrically with the exception of the yen and extreme policy that I would say the combination of China weakness plus the commodity price issues in Europe do definitely point to more structural headwinds as far as European growth goes for the next few years.</p>

<p>You mentioned the yen and you put a note overnight that I thought was fascinating.</p>

<p>Basically saying it’s broken and talking about yield curve control and talking about the whole plan that Japan is trying to stick to.</p>

<p>Does this mean that you think we might not see some sort of massive breach, some sort of dramatic shift in policy that’s just going to be a slow burn as expressed in an ongoing weakening yen and not necessarily leading to this disruption on a global level? Some people were afraid of.</p>

<p>It’s a very interesting dynamic in Japan.</p>

<p>In some sense, it’s the biggest monetary experiment in history taking place.</p>

<p>But if you look at the dynamics for a couple of things that are worth noting.</p>

<p>The first one, as you said, is apart from those free bonds at the back of Japan, its targets and everything else is essentially decoupled.</p>

<p>So we’re no longer essentially in a hilltop control framework.</p>

<p>We’re just in a specific bond CAC framework for its specific bonds, but everything else.</p>

<p>If you look at swap levels in terms of swap spreads and the swap yields are implying everything’s already started to adjust.</p>

<p>The other point is the Bank of Japan now effectively owns the entirety of those or that near entire tier of those specific funds they’re targeting.</p>

<p>So the point is, even if the cap goes, the only institution that will face losses on those bonds of the Bank of Japan itself.</p>

<p>So I do think it will be disruptive.</p>

<p>But the way it’s being managed and the way the markets de facto control, in any case, it may mean it’s less disruptive than some of the more extreme scenarios that people are putting out.</p>

<p>George, you went back 40 years and there have been five, including this one, manufactured surges in Japan of inflation.</p>

<p>They’ve been manufacturing inflation up.</p>

<p>We go to 3 percent.</p>

<p>Inflation is there.</p>

<p>Inflation now is corrodes, inflation manufactured and is it a fiction? So so far, it’s been imported inflation and very high commodity prices have helped, the very weak yen has helped.</p>

<p>And what he’s trying to do and I think this is why people will surprised that it’s the first genuine attempt to shift the entire inflation regime.</p>

<p>He’s trying to make that feed into wages, into core services.</p>

<p>And if you look at the data, it is slowly starting to work.</p>

<p>So Core Services Corp.</p>

<p>is starting to move wider.</p>

<p>So maybe he will go down in history as the first Japanese central banker that’s able to move Japan out of this low inflation equilibrium.</p>

<p>And if that happens, I think it would be a very, very globally significant event in the sense that the last bastion of disinflation, so to speak, will have ended.</p>

<p>George, can I ask a stupid question? What happens when a central bank loses money? That’s a very interesting and important question.</p>

<p>I think the answer is fairly straightforward, at least from my perspective, not much.</p>

<p>So we already have the RBA, for example, running negative equity because they’re losing money as the price of those bonds people have gone down.</p>

<p>The Fed is is essentially also losing money on its QE portfolio.</p>

<p>But when we look at the balance sheet of a central bank, we have to remember it’s very different from any sort of private sector institution because the central bank prints its own money.</p>

<p>So, yes, there are discussions around loss of potential credibility that central banks would need to be recapitalized.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, these are all balance sheet technical questions.</p>

<p>I think in practice, it doesn’t really mean anything they charge.</p>

<p>Wonderful to hear from you, sir.</p>

<p>As always, good to catch you up, mate.</p>

<p>George, south of Alice, they have Deutsche Bank out of London.</p>

<p>Isn’t a hedge fund managers dream, T.K.? What happens when you lose money? Not much.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I’ll let you tell.</p>

<p>That’s the size of the institution.</p>

<p>And I’m really at the heart of what Allan Meltzer did for years in history of the Fed.</p>

<p>They’re just that big where if they lose money, it’s one big.</p>

<p>So what I would state and occur out with a superb article today with a team General Ando and others worldwide on the challenge is that central banks have and I know I think it’s critical.</p>

<p>Then again, these the debt price movements I’m seeing are not normal.</p>

<p>I thought your perspective on Japan was really important.</p>

<p>I’ve often criticized the BMJ.</p>

<p>I’ve got the head in the sand operation ostrich chef when assets hike in their stock, that doing nothing.</p>

<p>I truly believe this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to reset inflation expectations higher and good luck to them.</p>

<p>Let’s see if this works out.</p>

<p>Equity futures right now are negative.</p>

<p>On the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Mateo.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>I think the thing people really need to focus on the most is how long does the Fed keep that that funds rate really high.</p>

<p>So let’s say up to 5 percent.</p>

<p>We think it’s going to be a long time, six plus months, maybe a year.</p>

<p>That’s going to hurt equities.</p>

<p>We think that’s going to hurt risk.</p>

<p>That was my Schumacher.</p>

<p>That club had a macro strategy at Wells Fargo.</p>

<p>Fantastic catch out with him.</p>

<p>The attention turns from fixed income to earnings a little bit later.</p>

<p>Numbers from alphabet and numbers from Microsoft.</p>

<p>After the close, your market looks like this going into the open and found about one hour and 42 minutes away.</p>

<p>Equity futures dancy tenths of 1 percent on the S&amp;P.</p>

<p>Yo, it’s had a much, much lower now down nine basis points.</p>

<p>Tom, your yield on a 10 year for 15, 20 to watch yields and what price? Thank you for the huge response yesterday when I was going mental about price matters.</p>

<p>It’s not just about yield someone that knows that.</p>

<p>As Robert Tip, chief investment strategist, head of Global Bonds at PJM, where they’re really exceptional record of trying to find total return.</p>

<p>Robert, I look at the corporate, not the full faith and credit total return, but the Bloomberg corporate total return index.</p>

<p>And it’s something in the vicinity of a draw down of a negative 21 percent on price.</p>

<p>Do you just assume with Fed action that we enjoy bond prices lower and yields higher? I think the Fed is bringing us a gift here.</p>

<p>I think we’re having a regime shift and I think at the Fed, you know, the one that’s really been in the lead in the cycle is Bullard.</p>

<p>And I’m sure you remember his paper in 2016 about regime shifts.</p>

<p>You know, these markets, we don’t slowly go from this environment to that one.</p>

<p>And it’s a little bit different than six months ago, John.</p>

<p>And actually, we could be jumping back to an equilibrium that’s much more normal.</p>

<p>You know, the Fed funds rate the last 50 years has averaged 5 percent.</p>

<p>And right now, everyone is convinced that if the Fed does over four inches towards 5 percent, there’s going to be a hard landing.</p>

<p>But fear corporate bonds, if they inch over 4 percent and slow down and see how things are going.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of yield out there right now.</p>

<p>Long corporate bonds.</p>

<p>And it’s a real horse race as to whether, you know, those yields are peaking.</p>

<p>Those returns are a bottoming out here.</p>

<p>I mean, you have a nameless bond.</p>

<p>This is somebody’s reported earnings today.</p>

<p>Doesn’t matter who it is.</p>

<p>And they’re enjoying a four point one percent piece out 10 years, make it nine years.</p>

<p>And they’ve also enjoyed a 30 percent drop in price.</p>

<p>Robert, tell our listeners and viewers how they handle duration if they’ve enjoyed double digit losses in bonds.</p>

<p>Do you come in short duration or do you go out long duration to try to pick up coupon? Well, I think we’ve normalized here.</p>

<p>I think this is an environment where people are supposed to be at some kind of a strategic bridge position in terms of their asset allocation, and that includes duration.</p>

<p>I mean, we have been in a period driven by central banks targeting unnaturally high inflation rates.</p>

<p>I mean, it wasn’t that long ago, 20, 19, even in 2020.</p>

<p>Sure.</p>

<p>Paul was talking about 25 years of failure to get inflation up to 2 percent.</p>

<p>And they haven’t.</p>

<p>Interest rates are incredibly low.</p>

<p>But now that’s changed.</p>

<p>And with Covid, with all that terrible things that have happened.</p>

<p>One positive is they’re resetting interest rates higher.</p>

<p>And so I think that, you know, five, 10 years from now, when we look back, inflation will be lower than it is now.</p>

<p>Growth will probably be lower than it has been certainly the last couple of years.</p>

<p>And this will a bit of reset.</p>

<p>So whether.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>You know, 4 percent, four and a half percent, five percent.</p>

<p>What’s going to be that peak level of rates? I don’t know.</p>

<p>But I think we’re in the zone of that peak in terms of interest rates.</p>

<p>But it’s not going to be an up and all the way back down unless something unforeseen happens.</p>

<p>This is a setup kind of like ninety four ninety five where rates go up, they stabilize.</p>

<p>Now that ends up boosting bond returns for the long run.</p>

<p>The bond returns perhaps in investment grade corporates as you are talking about, what about just in 10 year treasuries at a time when people are talking about normalizing at higher yields.</p>

<p>I think long duration, high quality, like 10 year treasuries.</p>

<p>It’s more balanced.</p>

<p>I think that, you know, if the Fed funds rate ends up going up to four and a quarter, four and a half, and the Fed at that point is saying, yeah, I mean, we’re kind of indifferent here, but we need inflation to come down.</p>

<p>And so if anything, that probably means that we maybe hike gap if that’s the case.</p>

<p>I think you’re going to have a little bit of a burn on the yield curve where those long yields that are lower than the short yields are going to be under pressure to move higher, to pay people compensation to take that duration.</p>

<p>Because of the uncertainty, to Tom’s point about price down in some of these corporate bonds that have coupons of 4 percent that were sold, say, a year two years ago and now have all in yield of something like 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent.</p>

<p>How much does that become a credit problem for these companies in a year when they have to start refinancing? Yes, so I think the whole dollar price.</p>

<p>The big dollar price changes, it creates mental problems for investors in terms of figuring out the right things to do.</p>

<p>And in terms of issuers, it creates less of a problem in the immediate future than you would imagine.</p>

<p>So on the issuer side, to your question, where it takes a long time for corporate debt structures, cost of capital to change the bonds, mature very slowly and they they issue and it’s incremental.</p>

<p>And if you’re in a world that’s going to support.</p>

<p>4 percent 10 year treasury for the long run here.</p>

<p>That’s probably a pretty high nominal growth economy.</p>

<p>And they’re gonna get by.</p>

<p>But if it can’t be a plus now, it’s gonna be a negative, but it’s a very slow burn.</p>

<p>The dollar price thing for investors, you know, it’s shocking.</p>

<p>You know, when you have a reset like we had before, from very high yields to very low yields, you get a one time jump in dollar prices where, you know, your bond future may be closer to 200 than 100 and it stays there for a long period of time.</p>

<p>It doesn’t really have any bearing on necessarily where things are going to go.</p>

<p>I think that’s the case with a lot of these bonds that are now at very, very deep discounts.</p>

<p>If we’re roughly in the yields on that, we’re going to be and then they’re going to very slowly take their time moving back to par.</p>

<p>But I think, you know, that shouldn’t distract you from the real valuation question, which is, is the yield right or not? Rob.</p>

<p>Awesome to hear from you.</p>

<p>Robert said that if PJM fixed income on this bond market bonds today firmer, looking pretty solid, actually yields lower by 8 basis points on a 10 year to 416.</p>

<p>At the front end of the curve on TV is that five basis points to 4 45.</p>

<p>We need to talk about the earnings.</p>

<p>And for Q3 it was always going to be about the guidance.</p>

<p>And what we’ve had this morning was a razor hold holding account, a race from Coca-Cola, a hold reaffirm any outlook from GM and a cut from 3M.</p>

<p>Tom, a little bit early this morning, very mixed so far today.</p>

<p>Jason Kelly Anna Edwards talked about this yesterday, but she was stunning when she talked about one in five companies maybe have the glory of decent cash flow, decent margins, decent revenue.</p>

<p>That’s Coca-Cola.</p>

<p>I would suggest maybe it’s not even one in five.</p>

<p>It’s even more narrow than that.</p>

<p>And we’ll see that narrowness today with Google and Microsoft this afternoon.</p>

<p>You know, I can see at the corner of my just sort of loitering gown in the distance.</p>

<p>Matt Miller, can I drop by the studio and catch up on the GMC? I’ve got the answers to my bitcoin floating around is that they do.</p>

<p>They float around.</p>

<p>Float around.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Let’s get tonight.</p>

<p>It’s at that depth, the knowledge, its analysis of crypto here.</p>

<p>Matt Levine out with a ISE or very holding Bloomberg Businessweek like a massive take on bitcoin.</p>

<p>I’ll read it because I’m there because it’s a room because Levine Then I see Matt on camera.</p>

<p>It’s great that a little package, you know, has a digital.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve got time for Dow Jones.</p>

<p>How much should we panic? Tons.</p>

<p>Tons to finally get on camera for a crypto.</p>

<p>The day to day noise is exceptionally high right now, and it’s really disturbing for a lot of investors, this type of volatility is something that we think you’ll see still for the next couple of quarters.</p>

<p>I think there’s more work to do here before the Fed really believes that short rates are offering a positive real yield.</p>

<p>I think the thing people really need to focus on the most is how long does the Fed keep that funds rate really high? I think the time has come for them to take a slower pace of rate hikes and wait and see what kind of shape the economy is in.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene, Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>Good morning, everyone.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg Surveillance, Jonathan Ferro, Lisa Abramowicz and Tom Keene.</p>

<p>We welcome all of you on Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg Television, the common theme of the earnings season from industrial America this morning John.</p>

<p>Right over to where we are with tech this afternoon is dollar ramification alphabet.</p>

<p>Microsoft coming up a little bit later in effects is a brand new excuse available to see.</p>

<p>It is worldwide and 3M is taking that opportunity to play.</p>

<p>Thanks, Tom.</p>

<p>It’s a real deal.</p>

<p>The dollar is a whole lot stronger.</p>

<p>And if you’re an international company that she had some, it makes a difference if you based here in the United States are some domestics.</p>

<p>Liz Ann Sonders with a great chart from Schwab’s showing that domestic company outperformance versus multinational international is well, the conversation Jordan, Rochester and George Savalas that we had earlier is just simply not about yen.</p>

<p>It’s about a holistic thing, the developing cum economies, the EMR economies, and there’s real dynamics out there.</p>

<p>Any company the rest of the world wants this fed to slow down the step down, no question.</p>

<p>A step the bling bling down 50 is that we are going to bleep down.</p>

<p>Nemo is not looking for that.</p>

<p>They reckon 75 for the next meeting and then another 75.</p>

<p>Then why do we all agree to it? We all agree 75.</p>

<p>I get it.</p>

<p>ECB and that to me, it’s the.</p>

<p>Then what? Well, and then at what point if they do pause, right.</p>

<p>Let’s say they do a step down and they get to four and a half percent.</p>

<p>Hold on a second then say anything.</p>

<p>I didn’t say it.</p>

<p>But if they don’t say anything, if they don’t do anything further, is the further path going to be another rate hike, as we heard from Robert Tip because of the inflationary pressure? Any call on the Fed is at the mercy of the CPI data and we get another CPI print Tom Keene a couple of weeks time.</p>

<p>And nation to nation, it’s a huge variance as well as jumbo events had earlier in June to stagger to the data here with inflation tied to the yield right now, 10 year yield four point one six percent, the real yield comes back from that 182 down to one 58.</p>

<p>Everything linked together off that key inflation report.</p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>And not just in Europe, in the United States as well.</p>

<p>Senator, time for this market worldwide this year and maybe beyond it to 2023.</p>

<p>Let’s wait for the price action for you.</p>

<p>Just briefly on the S&amp;P 500, slightly negative for much of this morning.</p>

<p>No drama, though.</p>

<p>We’re down about 13 on the S&amp;P with self-doubt by a third.</p>

<p>If 1 percent yields on a 10 year lower negative down 8 basis points on a 10 year to 416.</p>

<p>And in the affects market, T.K., softer euro here just a little bit weaker, 98, 63 on euro dollar.</p>

<p>If you’re a student of the Midwest and you had parents that were industrial on your college list was the West Point of manufacturing and engineering.</p>

<p>It was called General Motors Institute, now Kettering.</p>

<p>And never did they know that one of their students would come out to provide leadership for General Motors is Mary Barra.</p>

<p>And Matt Miller brings us to her today, the engineer from the General Motors.</p>

<p>And I’m looking forward to it, Mary.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for joining us.</p>

<p>Really appreciate it on such a busy day for you.</p>

<p>Let me pick up where these guys left off and ask you about the stronger dollar.</p>

<p>Obviously, the lion’s share of your revenue comes here in the U.S., but you still buy purchase a lot of parts in your supply chain from outside of the country.</p>

<p>Is a stronger dollar a tailwind for you? Well, I think, you know, there’s a lot of pressures right now when you look at commodity cost transportation, it’s just one of the elements and that we’re facing is not as significant for as it is for other companies, just based on our strong position in North America.</p>

<p>But we continue to to monitor and be impacted by each of these factors.</p>

<p>Rates obviously a huge factor as well.</p>

<p>We’ve seen it impacting other lenders.</p>

<p>And I’m wondering how it’s impacting GM Financial.</p>

<p>Where we are seeing GM Financial get back to you, I would say historically strong performance, I think we had especially strong performance last year and the year prior due to the strength of used cars pricing that’s coming down with interest rates, we are seeing a little softening on leasing.</p>

<p>But overall, GM F is performing very well.</p>

<p>You know, the CEOs of JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs both this morning have said they see a recession as likely for the U.S.</p>

<p>I’m wondering your view, you have a unique position.</p>

<p>What’s the economy look like to you? How.</p>

<p>How is it unfolding? And car sales specifically.</p>

<p>Well, I’m gonna let calling a recession to the economists, not to not my expertise, but what I’ll tell you what we are seeing and we’re seeing still very strong demand for our products.</p>

<p>We’re seeing strong average transaction pricing that we we continue to be able to build on.</p>

<p>And so we are starting to see inventory build just a little bit, but well below levels that were in the past.</p>

<p>So overall, we’re still seeing a very strong consumer for our products.</p>

<p>And, you know, we’re watching carefully all the different signs.</p>

<p>But right now, it’s still very strong.</p>

<p>But what about inflation and the pressure on margins? I mean, does the stronger dollar balance that out? Are you seeing a big inflation in rise in the costs that you need to pay out for parts? And is that sort of squeezing your margins here? Well, we have.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>We have seen, you know, commodities, logistics.</p>

<p>You know, we work with our suppliers to make sure that we have a very healthy supplier base.</p>

<p>So all of those factors we tend to work to offset and we predicted this year would be about a 5000 or excuse me, 5 billion dollar impact.</p>

<p>And we are seeing that.</p>

<p>But we have worked effectively to find offsets.</p>

<p>And that’s part of our overall equation for this year, which is allowing us to still maintain guidance.</p>

<p>One big boost is going to be the Inflation Reduction Act, at least.</p>

<p>UBS says they see the IRA as very generous.</p>

<p>They say it has the potential to make the US a global Eevee battery hub.</p>

<p>How do you see the Inflation Reduction Act for GM? Well, General Motors was already investing in North America or in the United States, for instance.</p>

<p>You know, we have a battery plant in Ohio that’s ramping right now.</p>

<p>We have two others, one in Michigan, one in Tennessee that are also ramping.</p>

<p>So we were making the investments because we wanted to make sure we had a resilient supply chain.</p>

<p>After we’ve lived through so much disruption over the last few years.</p>

<p>So as the ISE came into was passed and we’re looking now for Treasury to set the rules, we think we’re very, very well-positioned.</p>

<p>And we do believe that the benefits of Iowa are either they will drive stronger adoption with the American consumer.</p>

<p>So we think it’s going to do exactly what was intended to do.</p>

<p>And we’re well positioned to benefit and and work with our consumers to make sure they have an Eevee that’s affordable, that they can really enjoy the benefits of NTV.</p>

<p>Are you still on track to sell a million of these in 2025 and beyond? We absolutely are.</p>

<p>You know, when you look at the lineup that we have, you starting with the Hummer to the lyric to now that the Chevy Silverado, even we just last week launched the GMC Sierra.</p>

<p>Evey along with the Chevrolet Blazer Eevee and the Equinox TV.</p>

<p>I think we’re gonna be well-positioned covering the important segments in the portfolio to reach that million unit level by 2025.</p>

<p>You do get a huge boost also from big truck margins, and I imagine that helps you to fund the TV business and get towards that target.</p>

<p>If we have a recession and you see sales of those big trucks as big ISE trucks drop, can you continue to fund the easy boost? We very much believe where we have a strong enough balance sheet and the strength of the business.</p>

<p>When you look at the truck, we have truck leadership.</p>

<p>We’ve had it since 2020 and we just did a major refresh to our light duty, full size trucks.</p>

<p>We have strong SUV as well.</p>

<p>And now the heavy duties we just revealed they’ll be next year.</p>

<p>So we think our product portfolio is going to position as well in the truck market.</p>

<p>I would also say midsize crossovers are very strong as well.</p>

<p>And the truck consumer, especially the full size truck consumer, they generally are not they don’t shop as many segments as maybe other customers of other segments do.</p>

<p>So we think we’re well-positioned and obviously will moderate based on what happens from an economy into a consumer buying perspective.</p>

<p>You know, earlier this year, people were asking if we were going to get back to a 17 million SAAR.</p>

<p>Now I’m hearing people ask if we’re going to go down to a 12 million SAAR.</p>

<p>What do you expect for car sales next year? Well, we know because of all of the economic conditions around the globe.</p>

<p>You know, we are looking and we’re planning for a more modest level.</p>

<p>We’re still going to protect for the upside because we don’t know our next year.</p>

<p>But you know where it can really depress levels right now because of all the semiconductor shortages and other supply chain issues.</p>

<p>So we think there’s an opportunity to go up ever so slightly next year.</p>

<p>But we’re going to be very conservative as we plan for next year.</p>

<p>But be ready, Dad, to take advantage if there is upside and there’s still a lot of unknowns.</p>

<p>We’ll provide more information on how we view 2023 and early next year.</p>

<p>All right, Mary, thanks so much for joining us.</p>

<p>Real pleasure talking to you on earnings day.</p>

<p>General Motors chief executive officer Mary Barra.</p>

<p>Mark Gurman.</p>

<p>Matt Miller.</p>

<p>Just awesome, as always.</p>

<p>Tell me this.</p>

<p>I’ve been willing to ask this question for you of you for ages.</p>

<p>How green is a nine thousand pound Hummer? Avey Just how green is that? Well, I suppose in in what sense do you mean there are zero tailpipe emissions? So it’s so super great.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Talk about how much goes into making a now 9000 pound Hummer, 80.</p>

<p>Then tell me about how much damage that does to the roads.</p>

<p>Tell me about the tire wear as well.</p>

<p>How much rubber will need to put on these cars? Just how green are these vehicle? And when you have that, the life of the vehicle, the damage it does to the road, the new tires that you’re going to need? Well, a madam is here to argue with.</p>

<p>Electricity is generated by coal.</p>

<p>That’s a problem as well.</p>

<p>But I think that people like Mary and it across the industry are looking for solutions to the climate crisis that we face.</p>

<p>So, yes, there are problems you could see or you could make the argument that it’s not much more green than Silverado.</p>

<p>It’s even bigger.</p>

<p>It’s even heavier.</p>

<p>But at least they’re making some headway in that direction.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t I be better off buying a smaller gas auto that’s un-American seems dangerous.</p>

<p>Would you want to drive around in a small winter? Wouldn’t that be more great if I hit you in Michael Barr? This is the ridiculous part of this conversation.</p>

<p>Is this just a fad that doesn’t really address what we need to address? I think it’s a piece of a might get if you’re selling motor cars.</p>

<p>I get that clearly.</p>

<p>And you can get the credits from the government to do so.</p>

<p>Americans love the elephant in the room here.</p>

<p>Americans do love going about it.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>We’re ready, guys.</p>

<p>What they like on.</p>

<p>You know, I hate to say you shouldn’t drive big trucks.</p>

<p>I’m just here to say that this green branding golf them seems to miss the mark a little bit.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree.</p>

<p>I don’t either.</p>

<p>T.K.</p>

<p>costs one hundred and ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>I can afford it.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Anyway, some snowfall is coming.</p>

<p>And our chief investment strategist says see if eight from New York.</p>

<p>This is pulling back.</p>

<p>And I love my Honda Civic for keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo Ricci.</p>

<p>Soon, CAC has formally taken over as the prime minister of the UK sitting outside Number 10 Downing Street.</p>

<p>Soon, that promise to fix the mistakes made by his predecessor lost trust.</p>

<p>He said the UK faces a profound economic crisis and that will mean difficult decisions to come.</p>

<p>NATO is increasingly concerned that Russia’s desperation over battlefield failures in Ukraine may lead the Kremlin to escalate the war.</p>

<p>That could involve a massive attack on a target like a dam or even a weapon of mass destruction.</p>

<p>NATO says that for now, there is no sign Moscow is actually preparing for such an attack.</p>

<p>Adidas has ended its partnership with Yay! The rapper and designer formerly known as Konya West.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, B.A.</p>

<p>has made controversial statements, including anti-Semitic posts on social media.</p>

<p>Now that’s turned his Yeezy line of sneakers into a lightning rod for criticism.</p>

<p>Adidas says that ending the deal will mean a negative impact of close to 250 million in net income.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>What people say they’re doing with their money and what they’re actually doing with their money.</p>

<p>I still think the gap between those two things is quite is quite wide here that flows, for example, are still pretty aggressive in both equities and bonds.</p>

<p>Chris, for owner of Strategic ISE, can I just say with colder the air, you gave it to pre maturity day on a curve inversion.</p>

<p>I think up there is that cool from Chris on dollar yen looking for 150 when we were at 115 and we closed at 115 last Thursday.</p>

<p>Oh, go 15.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>He was way out front on that.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>He gave it to my.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Mike.</p>

<p>Triple limiting cash.</p>

<p>You should check it.</p>

<p>Award Palmer Cash Tom Keene.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if that warrants somebody from Governor Bailey’s team said how do you handle leveraged versus what we’re going to see this week from Biogen, a Bank of England and of course, the ECB on Thursday.</p>

<p>Please stay with us through the week on earnings and we’ll be talking about the afternoon earnings as well, such as Microsoft and Google today.</p>

<p>Right now, we readjust on the equity markets with Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFR.</p>

<p>Always good to speak to him.</p>

<p>Sam, Julian, Emmanuel, keep score on a daily basis in every core of what we see and what he sees as a modeled eight point eight percent revenue growth.</p>

<p>How do you with all your experience, your star system, it’s S.F.</p>

<p>are a what does eight point eight revenue growth or whatever the number is going to be.</p>

<p>How does that distil down through the income statement to free cash flow? And then on the share price.</p>

<p>Well, good morning, Tom.</p>

<p>Thank you for the easy question.</p>

<p>Basically, what we’re looking for this year, or at least in the third quarter, is a 10 percent gain in revenues for the S&amp;P 500.</p>

<p>And that compares with 2 percent earnings growth.</p>

<p>Profit margins likely to slip a bit about seven and a half percent.</p>

<p>But when you look beneath, in a sense, the surface, the 10 percent growth really is driven by the energy sector as well as the communication services, consumer discretionary categories.</p>

<p>CAC is really expected to show only about a 5 percent gain in revenues.</p>

<p>We’re seeing a theme of alpha of individual stock selection.</p>

<p>Is this a time is within tumult? Now, is this a time in the era of individual stock selection, sector selection or get out of the market selection? Well, I think that you one could say that we are getting to the point where we might be looking toward the market and sectors, because as you probably are well aware of, you know, the Stock Traders Almanac calls November through April the best six months of the year.</p>

<p>And my seasonal rotation strategy will switch from the defensive staples and health care to the cyclical discretionary industrials, materials and tech at the end of October.</p>

<p>So historically, we are in the best period.</p>

<p>The sweet spot for the market, October of mid-term election years through October of the year after I have posted an average total return of 21 percent since World War 2 and has risen 100 percent of the time.</p>

<p>Sam, was the distinction for you between a bear market rally and the beginning of more sustainable economic and market cycle? Kailey Leinz.</p>

<p>Well, I would tend to say that you’ve got to see some factors that really confirm that the move higher to make it something that’s more like the beginning of a new bull market rather than simply a bear market rally.</p>

<p>One of the things we have not seen is a sharp capitulation in a sense, the increase in volatility.</p>

<p>I look at a rolling 15 day average between percentage of high and low for the S&amp;P 500.</p>

<p>Normally we peak in a bear market environment above two standard deviations.</p>

<p>Right now, we’re pretty much hugging the average.</p>

<p>So the volatility, the fear, the capitulation has really not been there yet.</p>

<p>And I think we probably need to see that before we can say that this bear market is over.</p>

<p>So how do you view the whole step down that we’ve been talking about or this idea that the Fed could decelerate its rate hikes, which is one reason some people have given as a narrative to the gains that we’ve seen over the past week.</p>

<p>Do you buy into that, that if the Fed is compelled to slow the pace of rate hikes, that’s a positive for stocks? Well, I think if they’re compelled, it could be for for reasons that are more ominous.</p>

<p>We have seen since World War 2 that whenever we’ve had a year on year change and CPI exceeding six and a half percent, remember, we hit nine point one percent in June.</p>

<p>We have had not only a bear market, but also a recession and that these bear markets fell further and lasted longer than bear markets without recessions.</p>

<p>So I would tend to say that real concern is when we do acknowledge that we are in recession.</p>

<p>How deep will it be? And therefore, it was an earlier low in October, the low or simply a low.</p>

<p>And I would tend to say it’s a low because I’m looking for something closer to about 30 to 100 on the S&amp;P 500 that might end up toward the end of the first quarter of next year.</p>

<p>I sent.</p>

<p>Thank you, Sam Stovall of CSR.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Sounds like some semblance of this could go on for another 6 9 months.</p>

<p>Yeah, something like that, at least at the rally could in this sort of speaks to this idea that, OK, it’s a bear market rally, but let’s ride it.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>How many people are basically saying that? Well, my most insane because they’re concerned that they get beaten up by being too bearish, at least in the near term.</p>

<p>Chris Howard-Smith once had it right the first time.</p>

<p>And then let’s put it forward.</p>

<p>I tell you what, this game is tough.</p>

<p>It’s not a criticism of Chris Epps.</p>

<p>I mean, he’s very clear about that upfront.</p>

<p>Chris was talking about the weakness in earnings to come in the first half of 2003.</p>

<p>He brought that forward.</p>

<p>And now it just feels like people are Christian to back out.</p>

<p>People are pushing it back now.</p>

<p>This cycle’s just moved at such a speed that so hard to keep up with.</p>

<p>I think people are still guesses that we saw a rise.</p>

<p>This is a cycle.</p>

<p>Well, someone did it again.</p>

<p>Is it two? Yes.</p>

<p>Or is it they tend to fall ISE back to what Jumbo Vince said.</p>

<p>It is completely away from any demand structure.</p>

<p>It’s in the textbooks.</p>

<p>It’s all pandemic supply side dynamic.</p>

<p>And that tells me it’s not a cycle.</p>

<p>It’s original.</p>

<p>What I’ve heard is that because we’ve only had a couple of years of this post pandemic, we haven’t at the time to build up excess.</p>

<p>And I guess, Tom, to your point, it depends on the starting point.</p>

<p>Do you think this thing began, started after the pandemic or do you include the.</p>

<p>Ten years before the pandemic as well.</p>

<p>Well, the people who said that there weren’t excesses in the financial system are the same people saying that this could be a slow burn.</p>

<p>That was Robert Tip.</p>

<p>That was jumbo VAT.</p>

<p>Basically saying there will not be the trigger for financial stability at rates at four and a half percent.</p>

<p>And that they could stay there for longer, which will reset the concept of corporate valuations and corporate leaders on Microsoft today.</p>

<p>And what I’m doing is just going back and comparing where we are now to 2019 preshow damage.</p>

<p>And that’s that’s the the elite group of equities that have been able to improve on that.</p>

<p>You look skeptical.</p>

<p>I just think what we’ve seen from central banks, we already seeing the intervention.</p>

<p>So this idea that it’s going to be this slow bleed, the police had to step back in and buy gilts.</p>

<p>The PIIGS had to intervene in the affects market.</p>

<p>The ECB had to come up with this transmission protection instrument.</p>

<p>That’s not been tested yet.</p>

<p>Talk about South Korea, similar story, obviously, but they’ve had to step back and do something on the credit side.</p>

<p>And I just wonder who’s next.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg just quit.</p>

<p>I speak news to.</p>

<p>60 minutes away from the opening bell, live from New York City.</p>

<p>Good morning to you.</p>

<p>The price action shaping up as follows as we approach that opening bell equity features slightly negative on the S&amp;P, but down four tenths of one percent.</p>

<p>We are down 14 points, 10 of RTX this morning.</p>

<p>As for the guidance, you got a race from Coca-Cola hold reaffirming from GM at a cut from 3M after the close a little bit later, you’ll hear from Alphabet A Microsoft getting to all of that.</p>

<p>The bond market support, if you slow it down 8 basis points on a 10 year slump to four point twenty six percent in America right now.</p>

<p>Let us look at possibly your Book of the Year.</p>

<p>My Book of the Year for the first time ever.</p>

<p>I did it so early in the year on the shock of the war and Vladimir Putin and what we saw Putin’s world is my Book of the Year.</p>

<p>But look at this short, readable mega threads, mega threats.</p>

<p>Nouriel Roubini, crisis economics coming out of the crisis now this shockingly readable.</p>

<p>Nouriel Roubini joins us for the entire half hour.</p>

<p>I’m going to go back.</p>

<p>I want to give people a little vignette of years in my relationship.</p>

<p>We’re sitting in a wood paneled Davos like bar, and there’s a very famous secretary of treasury sitting somewhat near us.</p>

<p>And you and I walked through the excesses of 0 5 0 6.</p>

<p>And you nailed 2008.</p>

<p>Are we there again? Yes, we’re here again.</p>

<p>But in addition to the economic, monetary and financial risks and there are new ones now we’re going towards stagflation like we’ve never seen since the 70s.</p>

<p>In the book, I point out that there are also geopolitical risk like we are on a confrontation.</p>

<p>We have some revisionist powers like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea that are challenging the geopolitical order that the U.S.</p>

<p>and the West.</p>

<p>And that’s going to lead potentially to conflict.</p>

<p>There are environmental risks that are very severe.</p>

<p>There are health risks coming from pandemics.</p>

<p>And there is a relation between global climate change and pandemics.</p>

<p>There are technological risks coming from a machine learning, robotic automation, destruction of jobs.</p>

<p>There’s a backlash against globalization.</p>

<p>And we’re going to go to a world that is the global ISE.</p>

<p>There are political risk with polarization and where radical extremist party of the extreme right and extreme left coming to power both in advanced economies and in emerging markets.</p>

<p>And on top of it, we have amount of the debt like we’ve never seen before.</p>

<p>Explicit that, well, that’s what it is.</p>

<p>Right.</p>

<p>Where is the confluence of all these mega threats? Let us forget that Lipski at IMF was heated about the debt buildup on the back of your book.</p>

<p>You’ve got a guy named Rogoff from Harvard, Bremmer of Eurasia.</p>

<p>Dr.</p>

<p>El-Erian from Cambridge.</p>

<p>Martin.</p>

<p>Wolf, always wonderful at the FTSE.</p>

<p>And at the very top, the quote of the season from Taleb, The Gravity’s Return to the Physics.</p>

<p>We’ve got a higher real yield now.</p>

<p>We’ve got a risk free rate now.</p>

<p>What are the ramifications in our economic system that the gravity is returned to our physics? Well, there were many insolvent agents in the economy goes private and public debt as a share of GDP has gone from 20 percent to 350 globally between 2000 and today.</p>

<p>In advanced economies, more like 420 and rising in the U.S.</p>

<p>is now higher than after the Great Depression and after World War Two.</p>

<p>And we’re not out of a Great Depression or a major war.</p>

<p>And until now, even if you had zombie households, corporates, banks, shadow banks, governments, countries that were bailed out there were bailed out during the global financial crisis.</p>

<p>Zero policy rates, negative quantities of credit easing it even during the Covid crisis, many of them were fragile.</p>

<p>They were bailed out again.</p>

<p>We went back to get even more of the same this time around.</p>

<p>Instead, it’s different because we have so much debt and central banks like the Fed have to increase interest rates to fight inflation so that zombie institutions are going to go bankrupt.</p>

<p>That’s why not only we’re going to have inflation and stagflation, but whatever stagflation or that crisis in the 70s, we had negative supply shock 73 79, but with very low debt ratios.</p>

<p>So we didn’t have a debt crisis in advanced economies with one in Latin America, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil borrowed too much in the 70s.</p>

<p>All Volcker jacked up interest rates 20 percent.</p>

<p>They went bankrupt after the GFC.</p>

<p>We had the debt problems, mortgages, they had housing that bank that and where the debt crisis by was a negative aggregate demand shock and therefore we had lost elation and deflation.</p>

<p>Today we have the worst of the 70s with that massive amount of stagflation, very negative supply shock in the book.</p>

<p>Identify eleven new ones over the medium term and at the same time where that ratio like we have never seen before.</p>

<p>So we get stagflation.</p>

<p>That’s great.</p>

<p>Don’t give us the eleven themes.</p>

<p>John Tucker will be zero.</p>

<p>I was waiting for the 11th.</p>

<p>Did you use this phrase in there? I could tell you this in the sound bite about the left and I’m not going to give you said zombie institutions.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Where are they? And are you talking about countries now and not companies? Not households, not private balance sheets? Are you talking about country sufferance? Well, there are plenty of.</p>

<p>Is that in trouble in emerging markets? We know what has happened in Lebanon.</p>

<p>What has happened in Zambia? What has happened in Sri Lanka and there is about 40 of them that the IMF and the World Bank said that they are on the verge of having that crisis severe, that crises because of what’s happening.</p>

<p>And look what happened to the United Kingdom that now is starting to be placed in like an emerging market with the fiscal stimulus reckless, forcing the Bank of England essentially to monetize it, and then the currency falling and rates going much higher until they reverse themselves.</p>

<p>So it has happened in Greece.</p>

<p>It’s happening in the UK, could happen in Italy, of course, where a large number of not only emerging markets that are threatened, but also of advanced economies of various IBEX.</p>

<p>So over the last 10 years, we’ve had a series of countercyclical circuit, right? Yes.</p>

<p>Fiscal had the capacity to do that.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Central banks had the capacity to do that.</p>

<p>Now, seemingly, we’re questioning the capacity of those institutions, central banks, sovereigns, to be able to do so this time around.</p>

<p>You offer solutions in this book to what are they? Well, for every one of these mega threads, there is a solution.</p>

<p>But then there are two final chapter one about a dystopian future where all these threads materialize.</p>

<p>They feed on each other.</p>

<p>And it is not just the end of the world economy could be even global war.</p>

<p>And there is a less dystopian future in chapter twelve where we have the policies nationally and internationally that leads us to a better outcome.</p>

<p>The problem is there are both domestic political constraints and geopolitical and political constraints to achieving the best solution.</p>

<p>And I’ll give you an example of global climate change domestically in this country.</p>

<p>Half of the country doesn’t believe in it, too.</p>

<p>There is a conflict between generation.</p>

<p>The young people care about the future of the elite class at the international level.</p>

<p>There is a free rider problem.</p>

<p>If a country cuts emissions to zero, nobody else does it.</p>

<p>Then they don’t get benefit then only the cost.</p>

<p>Not because of geopolitics.</p>

<p>Well, timing India and China.</p>

<p>You should cut their emissions RTS in the next 20 years.</p>

<p>We create the problem.</p>

<p>In the last 200 years, 90 percent of the stock of emission came from advanced economies.</p>

<p>Nowhere is that them don’t grow dumb, become rich because that is a problem.</p>

<p>It’s through the flow of new emissions coming mostly from China and India.</p>

<p>So there are four elements of conflict, two domestic and international that they essentially imply that we’re not going to find that ISE solution.</p>

<p>So there’s lots of greenwashing going, wishing, giving fig leaves.</p>

<p>Lots of CSG is just talk and no action.</p>

<p>Glasgow cop was just a total failure in or slow motion train wreck, which goes to your point, John, about electric vehicles and I around a vehicle.</p>

<p>It hasn’t happened.</p>

<p>Is in the United States because they’re green.</p>

<p>There is an issue, though, going forward where the central banks and whether a lot of your thesis scenario is predicated on their inability to go through with what they need to do to get inflation down.</p>

<p>Is that your base case? Is that the most likely outcome? Yeah.</p>

<p>Right now, all central banks are playing tough and talking tough and acting tough, hawkish because they have a problem of credibility.</p>

<p>But in my view, there are two problems.</p>

<p>One probably is that if they tried to get to 2 percent inflation, that caused a recession.</p>

<p>And this recession is not going to be short and shallow is not going to be gone, then it is not going to be claimed that he is not gonna be two quarters of negative growth.</p>

<p>Then inflation collapses and they can rise again in the book.</p>

<p>Explain all the reasons why he’s going to be a severe recession because of the debt ratio.</p>

<p>Because we are going into fiscal and monetary tightening.</p>

<p>And at the same time, you not only have an economic crash, you’re going to have also fiscal crash.</p>

<p>We’re not only in fiscal dominance in this game of chicken between Treasury and Central Bank, worrying what the folks at the Bank of International Settlement call a debt trap that is so much private and public debt that if central banks try to fight inflation, they cause a crash of financial markets and not just the stockmarket.</p>

<p>That’s the least important credit market bond markets and that crash and financial crash feeds on the economic crash and vice versa.</p>

<p>And therefore, they’re going to win power.</p>

<p>And they’re gonna blink.</p>

<p>And the first one was the Bank of England.</p>

<p>The Fed is going to do the same.</p>

<p>This is going to do the same.</p>

<p>Have you been surprised that we haven’t seen some sort of catalyst, some sort of financial stress so far, given how quickly and quickly the Fed has already hiked rates? Well, we have not yet seen it.</p>

<p>Some people worried there is some major financial institution not in the US may go bust.</p>

<p>I think that the financial strains are gonna become more severe because right now the Fed is on the way to go from 3 towards 5 percent.</p>

<p>You already have a stock market down 25 percent.</p>

<p>NASDAQ given more public reads 33 percent.</p>

<p>You have the crush of Mimi of spark, bubble of the creep, the bubble, private equity, venture capital growth.</p>

<p>Everything is down, credit is down.</p>

<p>Leverage, the market is shutting down, the yellow market shutting down.</p>

<p>And the only thing they used to be safe there were governance bonds.</p>

<p>Now the prices correlate that positive equities because when inflation is rising, you lose money and your equity side loses money on your bond side.</p>

<p>Yields have gone from 1 to 4 and the price action downwards on bond has been worse than in equities.</p>

<p>30 percent losses or any 60, 40, 70, 30 or this part of the portfolio lost money on both hands.</p>

<p>There was nowhere to wait.</p>

<p>Even cash give you a negative real return because of inflation that alternatives they can protect against this tail risk, but they are not the traditional ones.</p>

<p>You’re a man of high conviction.</p>

<p>We know that.</p>

<p>You’ve also got some very smart friends get any pushback to this book that’s convinced you? Absolutely.</p>

<p>Anything makes you rethink how bad things might be and possibly made you think that possibly they could turn out better than you think.</p>

<p>Honestly, everyone was raided an any level as I.</p>

<p>The threats you’re talking about, they’re all too real.</p>

<p>Of course, that may be solution to them.</p>

<p>And I discussed them chapter by chapter in the final chapter about the less dystopian future.</p>

<p>But think of it this way.</p>

<p>I have gray hair.</p>

<p>I grew up in the 60s, 70s in Ian.</p>

<p>In Italy.</p>

<p>At that time, did I ever hear about climate change? A concept that worried about the nuclear ward.</p>

<p>After that, the town within Soviet U.S., there was nothing there worried about destroying most jobs, wearing the ISE winter with a stable democracy.</p>

<p>We didn’t have pandemics.</p>

<p>Last time around was 1918.</p>

<p>We had low debt ratios with law implicit debt because there was no aging population and all unfunded liabilities.</p>

<p>There were no major financial or economic crises.</p>

<p>This is a quantum shift.</p>

<p>There was a period in 1945 and the mid 80s that was something of a stable period global prosperity, welfare, peace and so on today.</p>

<p>These are threats that did not exist.</p>

<p>And those threats are more similar to the periods in 1918 1945 when with World War One, where were to get it, their passion threatened.</p>

<p>War.</p>

<p>Financial crises.</p>

<p>Inflation.</p>

<p>But inflation.</p>

<p>Deflation.</p>

<p>Nazis.</p>

<p>Fascists in Germany.</p>

<p>Italy.</p>

<p>France.</p>

<p>Spain.</p>

<p>And and Japan.</p>

<p>And World War 2.</p>

<p>And then where? The Holocaust? And then where? The Korean War? Yeah.</p>

<p>As as Neil Fergus on on Bloomberg is saying right now in his column this week, he says We’ll be lucky if you repeat the 1970s because it’s more possible we end up lagging, then came forth, meaning is talking about World War 3.</p>

<p>I love Neil, but can we be clear? That wasn’t a column.</p>

<p>That was a book on Bloomberg opinion.</p>

<p>Wasn’t if you read that he said it so long.</p>

<p>How low can you town, Neil? Columns are short.</p>

<p>I love this column because, you know, he’s speaking about it.</p>

<p>He’s speaking about the fact that it’s a meaningful chance that we’ve fallen, flicked and I write about in my own book.</p>

<p>There’s a chapter about the new Cold War between us.</p>

<p>And these are abusing his power.</p>

<p>And I say it could end up into a fatwa.</p>

<p>It’s a significant risk, no doubt.</p>

<p>Fantastic.</p>

<p>As always.</p>

<p>Know everybody’s going to stick with it.</p>

<p>I’ve got to go to go and get a drink after that and get ready for the next show.</p>

<p>OK.</p>

<p>And not be too depressing if you got a favorite quote yet in that book.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>You know, the last two lines lost to laugh because you know, why care? You know, I the last two words.</p>

<p>Our names are in it.</p>

<p>No, no.</p>

<p>The last one ISE of knowledge of is your name.</p>

<p>But the last two lines of the book is about the threat.</p>

<p>There we go.</p>

<p>We are Nouriel Roubini, staying here until, in fact.</p>

<p>Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Mateo.</p>

<p>Shares of UBS are rising.</p>

<p>The Swiss bank posted quarterly profit that beat estimates due to surging interest rates and cost control.</p>

<p>That will enable UBS to confirm a plan to return about 5.5 billion to investors this year.</p>

<p>And also deal liquidity in the market because there is a limit to what we can do.</p>

<p>Year today to last Friday, we were at four point six.</p>

<p>We will continue at the same level of speed.</p>

<p>So we should be getting certainly over the 5 billion towards the five and a half.</p>

<p>Commerce is leading the effort to boost automation, slimmed down management ranks and expand.</p>

<p>UBS has presence in US global news 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>I’m Lisa Matteo.</p>

<p>This is Bloomberg.</p>

<p>We likely likely have a recession in the US.</p>

<p>Going to have, I think most likely a recession, we might be in a recession.</p>

<p>And so until you get to that point that you see a change, whether it’s in labor, the demand side, you’re going to see central banks continue to move on that trajectory.</p>

<p>The economist from Goldman Sachs or Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, their point, talking, pontificating on a recession as well.</p>

<p>Of course, he’s got good advice.</p>

<p>Jan Hatzius, which helps as well.</p>

<p>Tom Keene Lisa Abramowicz.</p>

<p>We celebrate and continue with normal Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates, but far more of the new book must read mega threads.</p>

<p>I really can’t say enough about its terminus, its brevity.</p>

<p>It really is timely whether you agree with his caution.</p>

<p>And as he says very clearly, the final chapter of the book is how we get to an optimistic future.</p>

<p>I want to go to the past and I was so pleased that you mentioned on page 37 your colleague Alberto Alix Steel.</p>

<p>I still can’t believe we lost him.</p>

<p>It’s such a young age.</p>

<p>You two looked at the politics of our economic system, Roubini and Albert Alberto, our senior.</p>

<p>I want to bring it forward to where we are now, which is a massive dollar shortage in central banks.</p>

<p>They’ve got a plan, but they’re going to be overrun by a global dollar shortage.</p>

<p>Any.</p>

<p>And frankly, in developing economies is well.</p>

<p>Is there a dollar shortage now in is that the catalyst for central banks to blink is going to be one of the cartels? That is a dollar shortage.</p>

<p>And the reason interest is in United States is particularly dramatic for GM.</p>

<p>Labor terms of trade shock, those that are importing commodities, they have had a rise in interest rates because of what the Fed does and they have their own domestic inflation and the weakening of the currency that increases the real value in local currency over there on that.</p>

<p>So for them, it is a perfect storm.</p>

<p>Some of them have a lot of reserves.</p>

<p>Some of them don’t have reserves.</p>

<p>Some of them receive IMF money.</p>

<p>But that is right now, if it’s thinking of the dollar is implying even further tightening of financial conditions in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Now, I think that eventually the dollar is going to have to fall very sharply because webre twin fiscal and current account deficits in other advanced economies, you have a fiscal deficit.</p>

<p>But if a current account surplus and now we’re essentially using the dollar as a tool of national security and foreign policy, what a weapon izing it.</p>

<p>We saw sanctions against Russia, against Iran, North Korea, China, where starting, by the way, the CAC war with China, economic water, these what will be sanctioned, the must for dollar weakness.</p>

<p>How do we get there? Forget about this plaza that goes bananas.</p>

<p>Laugh.</p>

<p>It is going to be essentially the Fed, the wimping out.</p>

<p>Once you see a severe recession ending up mean, that means blinking, right? Yeah.</p>

<p>Blinking.</p>

<p>They’re going to blink and wimped out because you’ll have a severe recession wimp.</p>

<p>I have a new financial mega threat out.</p>

<p>Well, either you are a hot hardcore, you are a wimp pencil or a dove in this case, but that’s gonna happen.</p>

<p>And once the Fed is going to essentially prevent an economic and financial crisis or tried to prevent it by essentially stop raising rates, even inflation is too high, then the dollar is going to start off sharply weaken.</p>

<p>That’s going to be the trigger for the raising of the dollar is, of course, the tight monetary policy.</p>

<p>A viewer wrote in and wants to know what you’re doing with your money.</p>

<p>Considering that it seems pretty bleak out there, you know, you just stuff it into a mattress.</p>

<p>No, you don’t stuff it in the mattress because then even cash loses money because of inflation.</p>

<p>There are three solutions to the problems of inflation the basement of fiat currency, political and geopolitical risk and environmental risk.</p>

<p>Solution number one is to have very, very short term treasuries that are just in ingrates and don’t have the price action of long bonds that they’ve had fall in their price.</p>

<p>Secondly, you want to be in two tapes, even if tapes right now have not yet done well because inflation expectations are not yet the young course.</p>

<p>I think you want to go into gold and precious metal again.</p>

<p>Gold has not done very well because you had tight monetary policy, a strong dollar.</p>

<p>But if central banks are going to blink and without gold, there’s going rise in value.</p>

<p>Those are the rising value also because they’re enemies of the U.S.</p>

<p>are subject to sanctions.</p>

<p>China and I was worried that a trillion dollars of reserves in dollar to move to other things.</p>

<p>If you’re in Japan, they can be seen as the only thing that cannot be seized as gold.</p>

<p>Of course, not in the vault in New York or London, but in Beijing or in Moscow and so on.</p>

<p>And finally, appropriate types of real estate that that environmentally resilient because real estate compared to equities in a recession does well because you have more pricing power for rents and so on.</p>

<p>So a combination of these assets provide you in a optimized way a hedge against some of these tendencies.</p>

<p>On the flip side, you’ve always been brilliant on leverage in the system.</p>

<p>Um, credit.</p>

<p>And we’ve heard from one fund manager after another that there is resilience in this corporate credit sector, even with the debt that they have, even with the low coupons that they’re currently paying, that will reset higher.</p>

<p>Do you disagree? Do you think that people are overly sanguine? And about the upcoming credit cycle.</p>

<p>Yeah, right.</p>

<p>Right before the Covid crisis, the Fed was writing reports on financial stability, pointing out the leverage of the corporate sector.</p>

<p>Of course, high yield and fallen angels.</p>

<p>But then during Covid, these folks should have gone bust.</p>

<p>But they were bailed out.</p>

<p>We bought even high yield that you remember commercial paper and everybody under the sun.</p>

<p>So these zombies were bailed out and the excesses of having leverage loans, seizure laws, cough light got even worse and people have got even more in debt that this time around.</p>

<p>The party’s over.</p>

<p>Because the Fed for now will have to raise rates.</p>

<p>Does that sort of situation got to becoming possible? You get the double whammy for those corporates.</p>

<p>You get a piano because income is going to fall because of a recession and you’ll get that problem with that servicing initial rising and therefore then being corporate debt crises, one way avoided during the GFC and during the Covid crisis is snoring.</p>

<p>Now they see a low in leverage or a market are shutting down right now.</p>

<p>I want to get to Chapter 12.</p>

<p>You talk about a more optimistic future, utopian future.</p>

<p>You started by quoting the economist Yogi Berra.</p>

<p>I thought that was very good.</p>

<p>You’ve got a write in there about predictions and Yogi in the future and all that.</p>

<p>How do you get from Yogi Berra to a more optimistic future? Well, the model optimistic future starts.</p>

<p>We’ve essentially technological innovations like, for example, I don’t think we’re gonna be renewable.</p>

<p>Maybe fusion fusion happens.</p>

<p>Then you can have unlimited amount of essentially energy, a cheap cause.</p>

<p>We’ve no greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>We look like we are.</p>

<p>However, only 15 to 20 years away from fusion become a reality.</p>

<p>If it comes faster than we can increase the economic pie, we’re gonna reduce the cost of energy, going to stop greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>We can grow more.</p>

<p>What about our fractured or fractured political system, whether it’s pure Italy in the turn there to the right or what we see in the election year coming up in two weeks, how do we get B on this fractured political system? For now, we’re going to go to a world that is even more divided domestically.</p>

<p>There’s more polarization, there’s lack of partisanship, and it’s happening.</p>

<p>I mean, you have authoritarian regimes in power.</p>

<p>You have Putin in Russia.</p>

<p>You have Erdogan in Turkey.</p>

<p>You have Kozinski in Poland.</p>

<p>You have Orban in Hungary.</p>

<p>You have meloni neatly.</p>

<p>You have these Nazi Swedish Democrats now in Sweden.</p>

<p>You have the Brexit phenomenon.</p>

<p>You have the Trump phenomenon.</p>

<p>And he Latin America used to be only Venezuela, Argentina, populists of the left.</p>

<p>But in the last two year old Chile, Ecuador, they rule Colombia.</p>

<p>He’s got to be either the right or the left.</p>

<p>Turns out a little less.</p>

<p>So that’s where we’re going, unfortunately, is a world that is not liberal democracy.</p>

<p>If you sold the movie rights, you know, not.</p>

<p>DiCaprio, who love playing Roubini nor Roubini, where there’s the book.</p>

<p>Is that Mega Threats? Maybe a documentary.</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly right.</p>

<p>Tony, dangerous trends that imperil our future and how to survive them.</p>

<p>Do we survive the day? Yeah, we did.</p>

<p>Well, it’s still it’s 855 a.m..</p>

<p>So I think in New York City and we survive the day, we could say that coming up for you to be about.</p>

<p>There was very good, perhaps.</p>

<p>Richard Haass, when he comes on later, we’ll give us a sense of what mentioned by your Roubini.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>And who read the book and gave it a huge endorsement.</p>

<p>He’ll be on Bloomberg Television later today.</p>

<p>He is, of course, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
