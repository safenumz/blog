            "title": "[Finance English] Big Tech Earnings | Bloomberg Surveillance (2022.10.25)",
            "content": "Big Tech Earnings . The day to day volatility is mind boggling. . Traders here a whiplash. . And I think that’s true of people across the market. . We do think we’ll begin to see some moderation in inflation. . It’s clearly been surprising to the upside. . Month after month, I think investors are waiting for the other shoe to drop. . Have the markets seen their bottom? We’re all talking about the risk of recession. . But markets sell to me. . Don’t have it priced in. . The market is back in charge. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene, Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz life from New York City for our audience worldwide. . Good morning. . Good morning. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz Jonathan Ferro. . Equity Futures Negative T.K. . by four tenths of one per cent today. . All of big tech earnings kicking off later after the Big Sur currencies and other issue soon. . Equities got some free time today is going to look at as Microsoft shares, as Google’s share, as you say. . I got to stop tonight about 8:00 p.m., his time and look at that performance. . It starts today. . We were all on to Thursday, which is one of the busiest days of the year. . Did you see HSBC coming down? I read a part of London lost. . Your visions are moving in the wrong direction and they are a Chinese subset. . And I read every word of our report and HSBC, and you really wonder if that’s what’s coming down the pike. . The the follow on from a China with 3 percent GDP. . Chinese equities yesterday got absolutely hammered this morning again. . Lisa, renewed currency weakness for China. . How much is this going to really, really influence the policy when we’re talking about this yesterday? This isn’t going to necessarily be the check that it was at the United Kingdom simply because Xi Jinping doesn’t seem to care as much about the market response. . Still, I do wonder what businesses are going to do. . I mean, it’s HSBC continued to double down in China or do an increasing number of companies start moving away because it just isn’t necessarily economically sound to take a 736 40. . What you make of that WTNH right now, 736 40 Joel Weber just brought it up and it’s well outside to standard deviation. . Let’s review this. . Is it fixed? Is it floating? No. . The currency is managed around a band and right now we are definitely unmanaged on the Chinese currency. . I’m going to call John right now to a log access here in real China in real time. . You can do that in the Bloomberg terminal. . And there’s convexity in China. . There’s an acceleration here of yuan. . We’ve seen at terminals today, we’re selling terminals. . Give us an idea. . Let’s get to the price action this morning. . Good morning to you and good morning to the sales team here at Bloomberg as well. . Equity futures look like this. . Sunny S&amp;P 500 big sack reporting a little bit later after the close futures negative four tenths of one per cent on the S&amp;P, down about 15 points year or two lower by five or six basis points for 1837. . The euro still stuck beneath parity, 98 65, negative a tenth of 1 per cent. . And in a moment, some we’ll catch up with Yotam Rochester. . He’s looking at dollar and potentially 160. . 160 is the number in his note this morning. . Everybody recalibrating their in servos later on from Deutsche Bank. . It’s going to be interesting here to look at that. . I’m going to call it idiosyncratic story, but folded much in with Jordan. . John, is Sterling a 113 18 as we go to the Suna speech here in 30 minutes or so? It’s a massive. . Now what for the United Kingdom? We’ll keep it on that in about 25 minutes time, 30 minutes time. . Look at a crude 83 30 on WTI, Lisa, negative one point five per cent today. . I think it’s fair to say that the week starts today. . Right. . I mean, this is a massive week. . And today we start with the tech earnings, as well as a number of economic data points, including some of the house pricing data. . The S&amp;P CoreLogic case Schiller Index coming out at 9 a.m. . along with some F each at a house price data. . How much do you see a rollover in house prices and how quickly does this bleed into runs? Yesterday, Joel Weber saw Red start to come down actually quite significantly. . But it’s not going to trickle into the CPI for kind of quite a while. . So at what point does it matter to the Fed? At 1 p.m., we get the U.S. . selling forty two billion dollars of two year notes. . Who shows up? Right now, we’re seeing those yields continue to climb. . Can we breach that four and a half percent and sell it at that level? And how many people start piling in? Because perhaps this is the peak, as we heard yesterday. . Some are speculating today that earnings after the bell include Microsoft and Alphabet. . Microsoft is expected to see the slowest growth in sales going back to 2007 17. . Alphabet arguably more interested in John, because that’s the advertising tool, right? That’s the snap other side of the story. . Are we seeing advertisers start to pull back? Could that be a sign of some kind of broader trend in the economy? Alisa, thank you. . Looking for the earnings a little bit later, getting earnings right now on U.P.S.. . Here are some other numbers for you. . Revenue in line. . APAC beats some for the third quarter, 296 versus 265 year over year. . The estimate was to 85. . Adjusted EPS coming in at two ninety nine, reaffirming the outlook as well. . Some reaffirming the full year outlook this morning. . And this is important, again, on a logistics basis, a national basis with Federal Express is well, Julian Emanuel has his revenue model modeling right now up eight point eight percent revenue. . That’s. . That inflation induced revenue growth, you’re you’ve seen corporations. . That’s a big number. . Looking forward to GM added a bit later. . Some really want to find out what the tone is at this auto market in this country, given what’s happening with interest rates right now. . Tom Keene, you imagine going out and buying a new car? How much that’s going to cost you? Well, I think the interest rate story is profound and occurring with this leader has a global story on what the interest rate impact is on central banks. . The interest rate impact on their car is a three year depreciation year, maybe a four year depreciation. . And we haven’t even talked, as Lisa just alluded to, to a 7 percent mortgage. . What does that do in American? What’s it in the United Kingdom? I mean, no problem for autos, though, specifically. . I wonder if we go from undersupply to oversupply just like that in a space of 12 months. . That’s something UBS indicated potential. . Well, just a few weeks ago, we don’t talk enough about it, but this is the David Rosenberg theory. . There is a camp with Mr. . Rosenberg of Toronto that you’re going to see a rapid path to disinflation. . We saw that not once, John, but twice 1947 to 1953. . Stochastic up you go, inflation gloom. . Down you go. . Looking forward to those numbers a little bit later this morning, a Matt Miller going to catch up with the CEO of GM later on in this program. . We’re gonna catch up with John in Rochester now, the NFL strategist over at Nomura and Jordan. . I teased it a little bit earlier, a few minutes ago. . Let’s go there. . I saw the number 160 and dollar yen next to it in your note. . Walk us through it. . Well, that wasn’t my view, John. . It was the view from clients this time last week. . On Monday, I’ll sit next to you guys in that table. . So we met clients around the New York area and Connecticut as well. . And we’re looking for 155 at Nomura in dollar. . And I think at this Bank of Japan intervention, what you’ve clearly seen over the past, let’s say twelve hours, an extreme lack of volatility. . Now we’re in a 40 pit range where the previous two weeks have been a big volatile in terms of that march up to nearly 152, then that near 6 yen swing down on the intervention on Friday done during New York hours when liquidity was very thin. . And just after that Wall Street Journal article talking about the Fed becoming perhaps a bit more dovish in terms of when they will slowdown rate hike. . So I think we’ve had some temporary setbacks for that long dollar, dollar and trade. . But the fundamentals are still pretty clear, John, that the US interest rates are rising. . The Japanese are not. . That is your long dollar, dollar and carry trade. . But for me, on the fundamental side, from the trade side, the dollar yen is likely to keep rising from Japanese imports as this winds are going out and buying LNG, buying coal, buying oil, even though energy prices are cooling down seasonally as we get into winter. . Those prices should accelerate, pushing dollar and higher towards 155. . Another have the honor of a formal tea at the Bank of Japan with all the pomp and circumstance is different than the Fed folks at the Fed. . You’re over at Starbucks and you’re paying for it. . That’s how they do it in America. . Jordan, give us an insight on the debate at the Bank of Japan. . Is a Carol Massar only or is it actually a debate? They’re like there is a B.O. . here at Fed. . There’s definitely a debate Kuroda is, of course, representing the rest of the bank, Japan, when he speaks on their behalf. . But he is also the guy in charge. . And when we get to March and April, the question for clients is crowed as time comes to an end. . Who will be the next to lead the bank? Japan. . And will that lead to policy change? And if you look at rates, markets, rates, markets would tell you, yes, we think that something will change at least on the 10 year parts to the. . Will the band’s be wider on the yield curve control? Will they give it up altogether on the 10 year move it to the 5? If you look at the Japanese GDP curve, even 10 is below 10 years are trading above the sorts of levels set by the 10 year yield curve control. . So the markets are challenging the bank, Japan as we speak. . They’re holding onto that 10 year. . But the rest of the curve is pricing a change in policy to come. . And is the message so far for this year? Jordan, that currency vigilantes will win that we’re seeing that when it comes perhaps eventually to Japan, although it hasn’t happened yet. . And then it has come already to Great Britain, where you see a little bit more upside at least versus where you used to with the pound. . Indeed. . Well, for the Jenny used to be everyone’s risk off hedge of choice. . The only clients I’ve met who are long the yen are using in their portfolio as their potential risk off in case we get dollar weakness. . And as you’ve seen over this past year, that just hasn’t worked. . The fundamentals really did change for the yen compared to the global financial crash. . The carry trade still drives the power. . It does track U.S. yields quite well. . But on the trade side now, the trade deficit is not your risk off currency of choice when this is a risk off driven by energy prices. . And then for the UK, I think the UK is the canary in the coal mine for everybody around the world. . Even for the US. For Janet Yellen. . For the Fed. . You don’t want to do UK seems to be the conclusion from talking to foreign policy makers when it comes to budgetary constraints. . Don’t push it. . And also when it comes to interest rates, don’t suddenly get dovish and allow inflation to run hot. . I know we were just talking about the previous section used car prices. . I think they will continue to fall perhaps quite aggressively. . But labor markets are really tight and the risk now is the second round effects for services and that’s a lot harder to tame than inflation dragon. . So I think for the time being, the Fed’s go to 75, then they’ll do 75 again, then slow down into the new year. . That Wall Street Journal talked about the idea of perhaps slowing down to 50s come December. . That’s the debate for the dollar right now. . That’s why euro and cable have become quite boring to trade. . It’s. . Everyone’s waiting for this Fed meeting next week. . Yeah, I think the message will be, nope, we’re going ahead. . We’re still staying hawkish and the dollar will rally and Christmas and then waiting for the CPI print the week after that. . Jordan Awesome. . NIKKEI company, as always. . John Rochester of Nomura. . John, I was talking about dollar yen there and the intervention from the Bank of Japan. . The team here at Bloomberg broke down the data. . Four fifths of the weakness in the Japanese currency this year has come outside of Japanese trading hours, and that’s why the intervention from the BMJ time is coming. . Guess what? Outside of Japanese trading hours. . It’s just completely clumsy and it comes back to core theory. . And I guess some people can support their core theory, but shows people are saying, you got to be kidding me. . One thing Jordan mentioned there. . It’s absolutely critical is everyone’s looking at liquidity within the system, using the United Kingdom as the example. . And the F are A or a house much akin to labor or a house of another time and place is spiking up and is right at the moving average from the pandemic level. . Jordan said RTX got boring, rather boring. . I don’t think that anyone’s got ISE to 150 dollar. . Maybe it’s boring now relative to what we’ve seen over the last few months, in fact, the whole of this year. . Coming up, John Barron of BlackRock. . Looking forward to catching up with him in the next hour. . A comment from him on the midterms and the importance of it in about an hour from now. . Looking forward to that conversation live from New York City this morning. . Good morning. . This is Bloomberg. . Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Mateo in the U.K., where she soon CAC spent the summer predicting that Liz Truss would trash the UK with her plans if she became prime minister. . Well, now his prize for being right is a chance to fix the damage trust caused her neck. . We’ll meet King Charles, the third today to formally replace trust. . It’s a rapid turnaround for Suna, who lost a trust in the race for the job. . Bloomberg has learned that Adidas plans to end its partnership with Kenya West in recent weeks. . The rapper and designer has made controversial statements, including anti-Semitic posts on social media that’s turned his easy line into a lightning rod for criticism. . It’s estimated the brand is accounted for up to 8 percent of Adidas sales. . The US won’t change its stance toward China as a result of Xi Jinping seizing more power. . Advisers are still trying to set up a meeting between President Biden and the Chinese leader at the conclusion of the Communist Party Congress last week. . Gee placed allies in top posts and pave the way for a third five year term. . NATO is increasingly concerned that Russia’s desperation over battlefield failures in Ukraine may lead to the Kremlin to escalate the war. . And that could involve a massive attack on a target like a dam or even a weapon of mass destruction. . NATO says that for now, there’s no sign Moscow is actually preparing for such an attack. . An instant messaging service, WhatsApp says it’s fixed, an issue that’s cause of widespread outage. . Tens of thousands of users reported disruptions, including not being able to send messages or connect to the server. . WhatsApp is owned by metal platforms, global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake. . Powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . This is Bloomberg. . I can’t think of a Mark Gurman more consequential election that I’ve been involved in and we’ve been involved in. . You know, whether we maintain control of the Senate and the House is a big deal. . And so far, we’re running against the tide and we’re beating the tide two weeks away from the midterms. . The president of the United States live from New York City has the price action this morning. . And good morning to you. . Your equity mark is slightly negative on the S&amp;P 500 coming off the back of a big day of gains on the S&amp;P, a day of gains of more than one full percentage point to kick off the trading week with down about a half of 1 per cent this Tuesday morning. . It was a lower by six basis points for 1795 on a 10 year euro on negative a tenth of 1 percent, 98, 67. . And before we get deep into U.S. . politics, UK politics in about 15 minutes from now. . So we should hear from the new prime minister along as she sooner. . The player as he won’t be surrounded by supporters of that. . That’s nice. . And the solitary and alone. . Let you take a breath. . On this particular moment, it’s Tom Keene, three prime ministers and three cups of coffee. . Very difficult to implement austerity in a cost of living crisis in many places around the world. . Interesting. . We’ll talk a lot about this Lizzie BURDEN. . I know it loses at 10 Downing Street a bit less in about 10 minutes. . Yes, very good right now. . We will catch up with Annmarie Horden in Washington. . We are two weeks away. . It is Tuesday, two weeks away from an election. . Emory got 18 ways to go. . Here’s a political he leads. . Go back and forth. . And what I sense out here is a measure of apathy. . Give us your summary of what turnout looks like in the character of apathy in both parties. . We a lot of the polls and you could see that more than 50 percent and a lot of them say that they intend to go out to vote. . They want to go out to vote. . When you think about apathy, there does seem to be a sense from voters that there is this frustration when it comes to the economy right now. . And that continues to show up in every single poll across the board, whether it’s a question on the economy or inflation. . Those are the top priorities. . The issue is there’s not a lot the government can do to fix that right away. . Right. . The Democrats commonly say this is a global issue. . That is true. . They try to back away from some of the legislative measures they took that maybe the Republicans say added to inflation. . But overall, the world is dealing with inflation. . This is something that is is difficult for the current administration to try to defend, even though they are doing that. . But when you think of apathy, that’s where it’s coming from. . How can the growing impact my life? And this is what I’m struggling with. . And across the board, it’s gas prices. . It’s grocery bills. . And it’s paying for housing and rent to the candidates and the political experts. . Do they trust the polls? It’s a great question, a lot of people say you cannot trust the polls, President Biden yesterday speaking at the DNC headquarters says you cannot trust the polls because the polls have been wrong before. . You were just talking about really soon at the polls were wrong in United Kingdom during Brexit. . The polls have been wrong here in the United States. . But at the moment, what you are seeing and what is typical, especially for mid-term elections, is that the polls are they are getting closer and they’re getting more narrow as we head into the final 14 days. . We should also note that a lot of people off already even voted. . Right. . There’s been early voting for weeks in this country. . It’s been really difficult to balance the domestic and the international and Marie, but the international has really hung over everything when it comes to the domestic politics. . How much what do you make of the fact that certain Democrats are pressuring President Biden to speak with Vladimir Putin at this tenuous moment, two weeks ahead of the election? It’s an interesting moment because we also heard similar rhetoric regarding Ukraine from the Republicans. . Last week, Kevin McCarthy, the leader, the Republican leader of the House, likely will be the next speaker of the House if there is going to be a red wave in terms of the House talking about they’re not going to be a blank check for Ukraine, that there is not just going to be this constant funding for Ukraine while people are dealing with kitchen table issues every day and potentially going into a recession. . Now you have progressives saying maybe we should start negotiating with Russia to make sure that there is a diplomatic path forward for Ukraine. . The White House is saying there is not going to be any negotiations with Russia unless that is what Ukraine wants. . They constantly say nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. . We should know that the progressives did come out and say we are not against with the Biden administration is doing. . But they do want this path forward in terms of diplomacy. . And that’s as a number of issues are mounting on. . What I’m looking forward to is in December, when there potentially needs to be more spending, whether it’s military, financial, humanitarian aid, that the Bush administration is likely going to push for Ukraine. . Is there going to be more pushback not just from these Republicans, but also within their own party? How much of this is also being driven just by the inflationary outlook and what is what’s going to happen with gas prices heading into the winter? It’s a great question, because, Lisa, what’s coming up at December 5th? That’s when those EU sanctions are going to bite, which means it’s going to be incredibly challenging, even if you want to be able to accept Russian crude on the global oil market. . You can’t because maybe the shipper or the insurance company comes from a European which are dominate in this sector, whether it’s a Cypriot or a Greek ship. . It’s going to be challenging to get this crude around, which is why you saw at the last G7 they discussed a price cap that at this moment is a very contentious issue, because if they cannot get this price cap aboard, allowed this Russian crude to flow, that means that this Russian crude is likely going to only stay in Russia and potentially be shut ins. . And that is just going to elevate this price at a very difficult time. . Jonathan said it yesterday, though. . What they have going for them right now in Europe and even in the United States is the fact that is an incredibly warm out and potentially it’s going to be a warm winter. . MH Thank you. . Dan RTS, let’s pick it up right there. . Happy being talked about. . Gas prices in Europe down by more than 70 percent from the August peak ticket, down by more than 70 percent and today down by a couple of tenths of one percent. . But to see them back at ninety nine is their luck in nine. . Normally it’s warmer. . So whether it’s the weather and they’ve got the supply, they got the storage up to be specific. . So they met their storage targets ahead of schedule. . We brought those headlines along the way of the last couple of months and then we started to hit some warmer weather as the cooler period starts to click in some. . So October has been a whole lot harder. . We may start to bear in mind some day it can get pretty cold in parts of Europe, even in October. . So that’s the good news so far. . And we’ll see if that continues. . But Sandy, that’s contributed to a lower gas price in Europe over the last week or so. . Mr. . Rosenberg, earlier and there’s a whole school of thought here gaming out a sustained inflation, whatever the level is, whatever the country. . And there’s a lot of people saying the microeconomics of the system clicks in and down. . You come to some form of disinflation that consistently some about a month ago, I think we were all tremendously concerned about industry getting shut down, rolling shutdowns throughout Europe, rolling blackouts throughout Europe. . And Lisa, now maybe you can park that for a moment, but no idea if that starts to reemerge as a conversation that weeks to come. . But still, we need to have a conversation about next winter and the winter after that and whether they can repeat the trick of getting that storage up to capacity where they want it to be in about twelve months from now. . So right now, one thing that I’ve been reading about is how there’s almost a glut of natural gas. . Some of these storage units. . So at what point do we start talking about how much of this has been priced into euro area valuations that have been completely beaten up? Gas prices right now, 98 handle in the Netherlands, still European benchmark, I mean. . It’s impressive. . Gee. . You know, the earnings aren’t that good. . We’ll talk about that. . Three hours away from the open about life from New York, good morning to you. . Your Tuesday morning price action looks a little something like there. . Sunny S&amp;P 500. . Negative a third of 1 percent after some big gains to kick off the trading week. . Yesterday on the S&amp;P, on the Nasdaq were down about two tenths of 1 percent. . This is how the bond market shaping up. . On Friday, we had a little look at 460 on a two year. . This Tuesday morning, we’re down another 4 basis points to 446 64. . They stay on the front end and go over to the other side of the pond, to the U.K., the gilts, the two year, two year bond yield in the U.K yesterday down 37 basis. . Covid biggest move in 30 years themselves. . Simone Foxman biggest as well. . The big move, lower down another 4 basis points this morning. . Seen that the new prime minister about to speak to them in about four minutes time. . The attention that shifts from him ready to the budget and then over to the Bank of England in about a week from now. . Your thoughts on this. . And John, I’m going to go to what we’ve done with Draghi at Davos and all. . Is this guy a technocrat like Draghi or is there something different here in the political equation? I think it would be wrong to call him a technocrat at this point. . Some what’s interesting to me actually at this point is whether the chancellor is Jeremy Hunt and whether we actually get the budget in the way we thought within the budget at the end of this month. . And what that looks like, do they go even further when it comes to spending cuts, further austerity? Possibly a loser here. . But, John, one final question. . Where does Mr Gove fit into this? Who is Michael Gove and where does he fit into the form? Probably a question for Felicity Burton and Ricci soon himself. . Tom Mackenzie, you read this. . I’m looking at GM right now. . Covid ended with EPA asset 225. . Any estimate at 189? Yeah, pretty much the other way. . But Mary Barra will join us later. . Matthew Miller will be speaking to her. . Let’s do this right now. . We need to go to 10 Downing Street. . Lizzie Burdon is there for this historic moment. . There have been many moments, Lizzie. . What will be the distinction today as he walks from the door to the podium versus when an optimistic Liz Truss walked to the podium weeks ago? What’s the key distinction this morning? To me, the key distinction between Russia seen I can lose trust is that he is a pragmatist and he has proved that throughout the pandemic. . He was actually accused of being a socialist, so generous with his pandemic support programs like the furlough scheme. . And indeed, he raised taxes to pay for healthcare, even though fundamentally he says that he is a tax cutter. . And European leaders are going to be hoping that that pragmatism trumps poses to Brexit as well. . Really soon, it’s really going to have to keep that in check on both taxes. . Unbreakable. . If he wants to keep the Tory right on his side and that along with the other employees who put him in power, not the party membership, not the public, and say that coalition is going to be fragile and and crucial. . There’s, you know, a lot of people on this side of the Atlantic that just want to stop talking about the UK and British politics. . Let’s get through the next couple of weeks. . Do we get a budget deal at the end of the month? And when the bank giving the meets, will they have a deeper understanding of how many Spanish spending cuts will actually get from this prime minister? Well, we’ve already heard from various Bank of England deputy governors in recent days, and they say the Bank of England, the Treasury have already been talking, even though reticent spokesmen will not yet confirm that the Chancellor is going to be Jeremy Hunt. . Although it looks increasingly likely or whether the day is going to be October the thirty first. . In soon knock more than any prime minister would be aware of the effect of surprising the markets. . And so you can probably expect that he is going to confirm who his chancellor will be and what the date of that budget will be later this afternoon, along with the rest of the cabinet. . Let’s how difficult is it for issuing a snack to issue cuts in words with respect to spending, given the fact that he is very wealthy, that he doesn’t necessarily represent the mainstream in any kind of populist way? I struggled to hear you say that, but in terms of this, the difficult job that lies ahead for rescue dog, even though he’s had two runs at being prime minister, the characterisation in the national press today is that the easy part is over now the difficult decisions begin. . But Labor leader Ken Starr has already characterizing it as austerity 2.0. . It’s very, very difficult politically. . But the good news for Russia, Su Keenan, is that he’s always said that it was going to be difficult, that he’s going to be honest with the public. . In fact, he resisted the temptation to say, I told you so interested nomics was imploding. . But he has laid the foundations to deliver these difficult decisions. . The thing is, he’s going to have a cabinet full of ministers who are going to want to bring back on money to spend on their pet projects. . And when he’s got to hold this coalition together, he’s not going to just want to disappoint anyone. . Test for the prime minister announced. . Some lecterns out in front of Number 10 Downing Street. . It’s his first appearance as prime minister to direct address the public in the UK to say he’s on time. . Well, he’s got to. . Is he going to be one of those prime ministers that late all the time? Well, that would be a Bill Clinton record call doing a Bill Clinton in Samoa. . You know, I don’t know your president, but it’s in that camp to take him. . Yeah. . My my head is spinning on his job. . Do you have a sense here as we await Russia’s sooner, that this is finally stability or is it going to be in the next two, three weeks the same chaos? Tracy Alloway. . There is a hope that this man is going to be the face of stability. . And Tom, I mentioned this and it might sound snarky, but I think it’s a hope for a lot of people in this market that after today, T.K., we can stop talking about the UK. . What does he have to do? To Lizzie’s point, we still need to work out who the chance is going to be. . Michelle, it’s gonna be Jeremy Hunt. . If that’s the case, okay. . That man needs a deeper understanding of what the fiscal approach is going to be and then it’s on to the bank having the new help from that. . So we just get back to where they were and we can move on from all of this and move on from it quickly. . The fact of the matter is that the British people, T.K., won’t move on from it quickly because this cost of living crisis that we’re talking about worldwide at the moment is dominating in the United Kingdom as well. . Interest rates are going to have to go higher. . Mortgage costs are getting more expensive and a cost of living time is going in the wrong direction. . Real rates are moving up there. . And as we heard from Jordan, Rochester’s United Kingdom, just OUTFRONT of many other nations in the struggle. . I’m Bloomberg Radio. . We welcome you. . A shot of 10 Downing Street with a different podium than the trust podium, more stark, more corporate. . I will editorialize and off on the port side, rather, on the starboard side. . The right side of the door is Mr. . Su Keenan will come out. . Is Lawrence the cat with his back to the door? Because there’s a rumor. . Will Mr Sonic live at 10 Downing Street when you’re that fence? Well, there we go. . I guess that was in the Zeitlin. . How many prime ministers has got camp out left town in the last few years? Lazy. . Can I just come to you quickly before the prime minister walks out? What is the governor of the bank having to want to hear today? Don’t worry about the stability he’s been promised. . He wants to know who the chancellor is and when this when this budget is going to be. . And if he can confirm that it is Jeremy Hunt and it’s now October the 1st first as expected. . The markets that we have today and the governor, I’ll be happy. . Ultimately, he wants cooperation between the economic institutions of the UK. . And we heard from the chief economist Hugh Pelle earlier taking a veiled, thinly veiled swipe at the trusts administration for really undermining the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England. . You would hope that that’s going to end now with this administration. . Thirty seven minutes after the hour. . Futures at negative 12 and the VIX. . Hundred thirty is of note here. . Earnings coming out. . We’ll get to that in a moment. . Lizzie, I want to sneak this in. . If I can. . And very importantly, John will hopefully go to IRNA on time. . Prime minister here. . Lizzie, will he tour the country? Will he like King Charles after the funeral? Will he? Will he go to Wales? Will he go to those cities that were labor and became conservative? Will he go to Scotland? What does a new PM do? I’m sure he will in his constituency, don’t forget up north in Yorkshire. . I think he might be the first prime minister from a Yorkshire constituency. . Correct me if I’m wrong. . He obviously took over. . You’ll know this, Tom from William Hague. . But he’s going to need to strengthen the union, because this chaos in the Tory party has only given Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party, confidence. . And he’s also going to have to charm the red wall seats that put Boris Johnson into office with such a landslide. . At the moment, it looks like the Tories will be wiped off the electoral map when they come to a general election. . So his message has been unite or die. . He’s going to have to unite the country as well as the party. . Unspoken, John, is he’s a allowed he’s 40 some years old. . He’s the youngest prime minister from 1812. . It’s an impressive statesman way back. . He’s very close to talk to love. . He’s a he’s a kid. . I think only a few years younger than Tony Blair was when he became. . Okay. . Thank you. . But you look at the John Tucker, see that as American politics and 42 a show. . It’s like in Finland, in Estonia. . This is could be Speaker Pelosi’s child. . I’m with you. . It’s show. . Houses everywhere. . You went there, right? Did it. . Leslie, we talked a lot about this being a parliamentary democracy that the leader of the Conservative Party needs to be able to govern the party within parliament. . Lisa, let’s talk about the party membership of the Conservatives. . Is this their guy? No, we wouldn’t know Audrey, because it never got to that I’m sure many of the membership were annoyed about that. . It could have ended up being so divisive. . It didn’t have to go to the membership. . But I don’t think it’s wise to say that he would have lost Patty Lawton because perhaps the membership would have had buyer’s remorse after putting trust into number 10. . But I’m sure that the party MP is grateful that we didn’t have to go through the drama, the psychodrama of a leadership election put out to the membership yet again, because this is it. . I mean, I’ve just been stood here seven weeks ago. . You’ll forgive me if I’ve got a bit of deja vu. . It’s unbelievable to me that we’ve been doing this the way we have. . I’ve said a few times we’ve got a system to deal with it. . This is the system to deal with it. . I do wonder if the certain aspects of the policies announced by Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, who we expect to be the chancellor in the weeks and months to come. . Tom, certain aspects that you might have to revisit, the number one that I’m thinking of is the idea that you only offer support to offset the energy pain through to April of next year. . I just wondered, T.K., whether that’s something they have to revisit pretty early on if the crisis after energy supplies continues. . There’s this word that’s propped up, I’ll say Sunday, maybe Saturday, but austerity and the new definition of austerity and the fundamental thing, John, as you mentioned earlier, may be Lisa, you mentioned it. . It is austerity within a higher nominal rate regime. . People at home, they don’t care about fancy bow tie, real read stuff. . They’re looking at higher nominal rates across everything they do. . The former government, the former leader, to be specific, less trusts tried to do something different some and it failed. . Markets weeded out very, very quickly. . And I just want to see what the options are available for any government right now facing down a cost of living crisis, high inflation in places like the United Kingdom. . What they can actually do? How much fiscal space is there to help out the people of countries like the United Kingdom? I believe we’ve lost Lizzy Burdett has some numbers in Berkeley Street. . Let’s go to Lawrence CAC. . You think, Larry? You think Larry’s got something to say on that probe? Sure. . Well, she said it’s deja vu over. . Can you imagine the jar do the right? Oh, honestly, seeing this one a few times, we all have we are waiting for the British prime minister, Rishi, soon that when he walks out of that door, he will do so as the leader of the Conservative Party and of the leader of the United Kingdom. . When those comments begin, we’ll bring those comments to you. . Take care. . We also need to talk about the earnings that are coming out. . And I will say, Ali DAX is something coming to talk about briefly, Adidas. . They have been silent for weeks on the relationship with Kenya West. . And finally this morning, they come out and Satish, they are terminating the partnership with Kenya. . No. . After the anti Semitic comments from him over the last couple of weeks. . Lisa, many people incredibly disappointed estate in this company this long to make this comment. . Wasn’t he responsible for about 8 percent of their sales or some something like that? And they’re saying that they’re going to take a write down. . The media fact is, two hundred and forty four forty six point five million dollar hit to net income in the current fiscal year. . You’re right. . It took them a long time because he’s pivotal to their sales. . At what point does this become, though, a deal breaker, given some of the recent shenanigans? Isn’t that disappointing, though, for companies that preach all of this stuff about diversity and inclusion? Do you get comments like that and they go silent for weeks because he’s key to their sales? Isn’t that absolutely ridiculous? Think about how many times companies want to distance themselves from certain individuals because they’ve done certain things, whether it’s drugs, steroids, performance enhancing drugs about to step away and then you get anti-Semitic comments by someone key to your company and you say nothing for weeks about it. . OK. . Just to be completely transparent. . This was a discussion at the dinner table because there were certain members of the family who really like Konya West’s music. . And can they keep listening to it? And they had this whole debate trying to rationalize it. . And he just said, you know what? You either have a credo or you have some sort of ethic that you follow or you don’t. . And that’s the bottom line. . That stock is down by about 4 percent in the premarket somewhat. . It’s talk about GM as well. . General Motors, that quarter adjusted EPS 225 estimate 180 night revenue just a little bit lighter. . Nothing overly concerning in this going into a conversation and interviewed some with the leader of GM a little bit later in the next hour and 15 minutes or so. . She’ll be sitting down with Matt Miller Alix Steel. . It’s a beast of its own. . And I’m going to give a major shout out to my colleague over at Citigroup, which I think was way out front on this, the absolute mediocrity of GM and the surge that we saw up through the pandemic and frankly, a roll over to revisit the mediocrity of 2018. . The 10 year annual return that Mary Barra has had to be challenged by is five point zero six percent, five percent a year. . Shareholder return. . Can you rationalize that given an auto company granted pandemic. . Granted national issues. . Granted technology issues and the rest. . But you just wonder, when is it safe to say they get dramatic where they start developing free cash flow like some of the Europeans? That Germanic? Yeah, I mean, it’s like Mercedes or BMW and and the rest. . I don’t know. . But I just there’s always a spin here. . There’s always something new. . They’re mentioned and electric vehicles today, they’re going to increase production and they’re OK. . Great. . Where’s the shareholder return? That’s what I just I’m looking for it at 5 percent per year. . You want the new excuse? Right now, 3M, 3M, the company sees full year adjusted EPS at ten dollars, 10 cents to 10, 35. . Previously they had seen 10, 30 to 10, 80. . What do they blame in drumroll, the uncertain macro environment and Rameau, the US dollar that we’ve got, that’s going to be the CAC. . But at some point there is some truth to this, right? I mean, the appreciation is pretty dramatic. . And how much are international companies from the U.S. . really going to suffer as a result? But this is the second downgrade to its outlook so far this year for 3M. . How many of these multinationals have to do that before there’s some sort of bigger sense? And how much really visibility do we have about how long this is going to continue for and really how much is has to do with the dollar? I mean, I can tell you’re somewhat skeptical, John, about whether no excuse for something else. . You know, drum roll. . Could it possibly be? I’m just saying, I’m not surprised. . Okay. . That’s all I’m saying. . I’m not surprised. . We’ll keep an eye on the earnings for you. . We understand the prime minister still not arrived at Number 10 Downing Street. . When he gets them. . We have that address. . We’ll bring that to you. . Okay. . The prime minister running late for an audience with the king. . A little bit earlier this morning. . This is a new king. . And know I don’t I’m not privy to the short meetings of an ancient queen. . But you wonder if this is a new style of King Charles where there’s a substantial conversation. . I don’t know. . I believe we’re following the now up the mountain from Buckingham Palace. . So we’re not doing it. . You want to do that? Let’s to come back and listen. . Not acceptable. . I really don’t want to do this kind of thing. . So, you know, I’ll have. . This week it. . Going to be who was going to pick him up within the autumnal glow. . All right. . The lead in just a moment. . Lisa, though, goes past horse guards parade. . I can’t hold on to Westminster. . There’s this ceremony today. . It’s at Number 10 Downing Street. . Tried to excuse. . It’s dumb. . I mean, I’ve been I’ve been living for this moment, Lisa, for 20 years. . Have you? It’s really as if everything has been built up to this. . Follow the car from the palace. . Do you love this guy? I mean, I know he married into a lot of money in that. . But how did he make his money? Was he a classic investment banker at Goldman? That kind of background, he came, you know. . You know, my design. . But he wasn’t like chief economist. . Let’s be clear. . He was a dealmaker. . Well, but this is the reason why it’s gonna be difficult for him to make some severe cuts to spending at a time of austerity given his own largesse. . I’m just wondering how that’s going. . I don’t buy into that. . But we’ve had we’ve had huge filthy rich people back centuries that have run things. . I mean, is it uncommon to have somebody being read and there’s loaded. . There’s levels of loaded. . But is it is. . So what? That he’s that wealthy and whose families are wealthy? Looks like they just come past Trafalgar Square. . So would you want him to stop at Greggs? I thought we went to this pick pick up some guy. . That’s when the prime minister actually arrives at Number 10 Downing Street. . Bring those comments to you. . Take you in to carry on following the car. . Well, I think we’re done. . I don’t think we have a choice. . Maybe. . Maybe their views of the buses are stopping, of course, here. . They they promenade back to 10 Downing Street, where Lizzie BURDEN is. . I want to get back to earnings in to say the tech earnings today. . And I think, Lisa, you mentioned this in your brief. . Google is the real first look at the future of digital advertising, which is a growing part of Amazon’s business. . And of course, there’s others out there. . And my problem is we conflate Google and was SNAP. . We can play Google and with Facebook. . And I just think that’s off the mark and then get a little look at Microsoft after the close as well. . So very important. . Big names then on to Thursday keeps open about Thursday. . First ISE huge. . You want to talk about tech. . Did you see the tech names in China yesterday? Absolutely hammered. . Alabama by T.J. . Dell at one point yesterday were all down about 20 percent. . I did a fancy chart of Alibaba and the plunged is the right word, John. . But back to a long term support line of where they’ve been for years that they go through to a crisis low. . No. . But they’re certainly back to a support that speaks ill of the equity markets and the trust in the new regime. . Let’s touch base with undercurrent on some of this, the Bloomberg chief Asia economic correspondent. . And we saw the events over the weekend. . We saw the fallout in this market. . And let me tell you, when the affects market ended, it continues. . Yeah, it does continue, at least with the currency, say you can point to fundamentals there, John. . The sell off in yuan was delayed. . It’s not clear that the authorities are allowing it to weaken. . We’re seeing it go back to levels both onshore and onshore. . We haven’t seen in some cases at all. . In fact, now that does, of course, affect the strong U.S. . dollar, but it does reflect what’s going on in China. . Sentiment is very negative and turning even more negative post Congress. . There’s no sign of a pivot on Covid zero. . No sign of a pivot on the real estate story either. . So that’s what’s happening in the equity stories. . I got to jump in. . The prime minister of the United Kingdom, Richie, soon act addressing the British people. . Let’s take a listen. . I’ve just been to Buckingham Palace and accepted His Majesty the King’s invitation to form a government in his name. . It is only right to explain why I’m standing here as your new prime minister. . Right now, our country is facing a profound economic crisis. . The aftermath of Covid still lingers. . Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains. . The world over. . I want to pay tribute to my predecessor, Liz Truss. . She was not wrong to want to improve growth in this country. . It is a noble aim, and I admired her restlessness to create change, but some mistakes were made not born of ill will or bad intentions. . Quite the opposite, in fact. . But mistakes nonetheless. . And I have been elected as leader of my party and your prime minister in part to fix them. . And that work begins immediately. . I will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government’s agenda. . This will mean difficult decisions to come. . But you saw me during Covid doing everything I could to protect people and businesses with schemes like furlough. . There are always limits. . More so now than ever. . But I promise you this I will bring that same compassion to the challenges we face today. . The government I lead will not leave the next generation, your children and grandchildren with a debt to settle. . That we were too weak to pay ourselves. . I will unite our country not with words, but with action. . I will work day in and day out to deliver for you. . This government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level. . Trust is earned and I will earn yours. . I will always be grateful to Boris Johnson for his incredible achievements as prime minister. . And I treasure his warmth and generosity of spirit. . And I know he would agree that the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual. . It is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us. . And the heart of that mandate is our manifesto. . I will deliver on its promise a stronger NHS, better schools, safer streets, control of our borders, protecting our environment, supporting our armed forces, levelling up and building an economy that embraces the opportunities of Brexit, where businesses invest, innovate and create jobs. . I understand how difficult this moment is. . After the billions of pounds, it cost us to combat Covid after all the dislocation that caused in the midst of a terrible war that must be seen successfully to its conclusions. . I fully appreciate how hard things are, and I understand too that I have work to do to restore trust. . After all, that has happened. . All I can say is that I am not daunted. . I know the high office. . I have accepted and I hope to live up to its demands. . But when the opportunity to serve comes along, you cannot question the moment, only your willingness. . So I stand here before you ready to lead our country into the future. . To put your needs above politics. . To reach out and build a government that represents the very best traditions of my party. . Together we can achieve incredible things. . We will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have made and fill tomorrow and every day thereafter with hope. . Thank you. . Rishi Su Keenan, British prime minister there the message, pretty simple, difficult decisions to come for the UK economy. . Mistakes have been made. . I’m here to fix them from New York City for our audience worldwide on TV and radio. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz. . Some Jonathan Ferro NIKKEI. . Pretty blunt to the point that tough decisions to come Dani Burger carefully worded. . I thought, you know, moving from the past to the very recent present, Twitter lit up as some of these phrases were mentioned. . But I do think, John, from many people, this is the first time they’ve heard the prime minister speak working to restore trust, Lisa, quote. . After all that has happened, trying to ride out some of the goodwill that he built over the Covid era and how much they did to extend some of the aid to individuals and including the furlough program. . How far does that get this administration at a time of potential austerity in the face of higher heating bills and just all in higher cost? He didn’t use the word austerity. . The message, isn’t it? We will not leave it to the next generation with debt to Satya Nadella. . Ultimately, Lisa, they’re going to go hard Jonathan Ferro. . And this is the difficult thing. . How do you effect an economy in optimism at a time when that’s going to mean some serious declines in the economic output of this nation? Some people talking about this as the world’s sixth biggest economy. . For now, we have heard that from economists were how delayed do you project a feeling of strength into the future? Less about an outside number, 10 Downing Street. . Let’s head over to Lizzie. . Now, Lizzie, you’ve followed that address by the British prime minister. . It went on for several minutes or so. . Talk to us about the reaction in the U.K. . so far. . Well, the reaction behind the black doll was raucous applause, really? I was trying to push hard on the reset button that he did pay tribute to Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, but brutally, very clearly. . He said that trust under trust. . Mistakes were made. . And he also took a swipe at Boris Johnson, saying that now is the time for professionalism, accountability, integrity. . But he still needs to draw that thread of continuity between himself and Boris Johnson because he is riding on Johnson’s Monday here. . And that’s why he’s underscored his commitment to the manifesto from 2019. . He was referring to Brexit levelling up the National Health Service. . All the pledges that he needs to deliver on if he wants to be elected by the electorate in two years time, January 2025 at the latest. . But ultimately, as you say, is a realistic message. . That’s the message that he was trying to deliver throughout his leadership campaign in the summer. . This was kind of his moment to say, I told you so. . He resisted the temptation until he’s been stood in front of that black door. . He didn’t say it well to us. . Atomics was imploding. . But now, yeah, he’s going to have to make some really, really tough decisions and harder yet because of the damage trust trust bequeathed him. . Leslie, how important is it for issues to now not to be speaking to fellow employees, but to the general population? For example, in two years time to actually see some programs through after such tumult out with three prime ministers so far this year? Well, yeah, he’s got a big job on his hands. . He needs to unite the party, but also the country. . And that goes hand-in-hand with steering Britain out of this economic crisis, because, as you say, he’s going to have to choose between tax rises and spending cuts. . And if he goes too hard on the tax rises, he’s going to alienate the Tory right. . And they’ve put him in to number 10. . So it’s very difficult. . And as you say as well, he’s going to have to appear he’s going to have to convince the public that he’s genuinely empathetic of that situation. . When he’s the word that is overwhelmingly associated with vicious eunuch surveys show is not that he’s the youngest prime minister in over 200 years or that he’s the first British Asian in office. . Is the fact that he’s rich. . And I think that is interesting when you contrast that with American politics, where that seemed to serve Donald Trump well, it was almost giving him credibility Alisyn. . Wonderful to hear from you, Lucy Burton. . Outside number 10 Downing Street, minutes after hearing from the British prime minister really soon. . The message, the headline. . Difficult decisions to come from New York. . Let’s wait for the price action for you on the S&amp;P 500 slightly negative. . We’re down a quarter of one per cent on the S&amp;P with a big DAX earnings. . Still to come. . Futures are negative just a little bit. . Yields are lower by 7 basis points 417 32 and the earnings keep coming through. . And I can tell you, Coca-Cola out just moments ago, raising their full year guidance, full year adjusted organic revenue. . Now looking at plus 14 percent to plus 15 per cent on the estimate had been positive, thirteen point four percent. . Better numbers from Kodak moments ago nailed it. . And this has to do with pricing persistency. . Can you raise prices into inflation? Julian Emanuel has modelled eight point eight percent revenue lift. . And here’s Coke just as a quick. . Blush, John, I meant to say leading the way a revenue beat a well, organic revenue up 16 per cent, the estimate, Lisa. . Nine point eight one. . And that’s even including a five to six percent currency headwind. . So it wasn’t an excuse even though they did a nod to it, which is sort of your question of it’s one thing to blame the effects issue. . It’s another to say that’s the reason for the disappointment. . Reaffirming your outlook is as good as a beat these days. . I would suggest GM did that as well about 15, 20 minutes ago. . Leaks from a catch of the CEO in about an hour from now. . Yeah, that’s one of the things that are going to be watching to to whip through some of the other things that we’re looking at today. . We got a slew of economic data, including August, U.S., FHA, FAA, a house price index, as well as the S&amp;P CoreLogic 20 City Index. . How much do you start to see those prices roll over? And what’s the lead time really into the core CPI measures that we look at? 1 p.m., the U.S. . is selling 42 billion dollars of two year notes. . Who shows up for these bond auctions? It looks attractive for some. . And others say perhaps it has to go five higher for looking at a 5 percent Fed funds rate for a year or more. . And today, the earnings do continue after the bell. . We are sort of drum beating to Microsoft and Alphabet, given that those account for such a huge proportion of the overall index. . And Microsoft, I believe, John, is expected to come in with the lowest sales increase going back to 2017. . So how much does that really give a guide for where we are right now? A couple of names. . So we’ll have something to say about foreign exchange up short stuff a little bit later this afternoon. . Then the big names like Apple coming up on New Year’s Day. . I think it’s like 2, 3 percent as sort of the typical average model. . And we’re clearly out over there for even 6 percent. . You may have a few that are 7 or 8 percent substantial. . We get lucky this morning. . Jump out around a table with us, the head of the BlackRock Investment Institute and formerly so much more than that. . John, fantastic to catch up with you, sir. . I read the weekly note from the BlackRock Investment Institute that came out just yesterday. . And you talked about the significance of the midterms. . And you guys don’t think they’re that significant in the future returns over the next several months. . Why? First of all, it’s so great to be here. . You know, we think the usual playbook for the midterm is that, you know, if you have divide guard, divided government or a house, as it tends to be a boost for markets. . But as anything else this time around them and usual playbooks don’t apply. . We think the main stories about their foretold recession that we’re going to have we believe in in the current in the next year. . And as a result, we think that this is the second sideshow. . The important for the future of the country in everything. . But in terms of markets, we don’t think that’s an important driver. . Swap lines, front, center or major discussion at the meetings in Washington here a week or so ago. . Give us BlackRock estimate of how countries will have to go to the Fed given the global power shortage, the liquidity that are out there is seen in FRB or the US. . Yeah. . You know, the important thing is here we are. . We’re seeing the most rapid tightening of financial conditions in a in a generation in a very long time. . We haven’t seen really the cracks yet appear on the system. . It’s remarkable to see all of the strengthening of the U.S. . dollar you’ve seen. . We’re not like the knock on a thing or cracks where we have seen under circumstances. . I think that creates a level of anxiety that was really clear at the IMF. . A lot of conversation about how we shore up the system in that context, swap line will be a will be a key key tool potentially in that environment. . But I think so far what is really surprising is that, you know, it’s been very stable despite despite what we’ve done all your academics at Princeton and your work with the Bank of Canada. . If we believe it’s non-linear, is we disinflation? Do you think we can succeed? That was stability or they’re going to be instabilities witness with Damian. . Sorry. . As today we looked at a Colombia piece going from ninety eight down to sixty three and a price of bun. . That’s a crack. . I think it’s very hard to see something that’s going to be a smooth landing in any way. . That’s true for the economy. . That’s true for the financial market in this context. . That’s why, you know, we think we’re not a clear path towards over a tightening of monetary policy, but it’s going to be very rocky. . We’re underweight equities, you know, as bearish as we’ve ever been, I guess, in terms of broad risk taking in this moment at some point is going to change. . But the reason is really because that tightening is it could be non-linear, as you say. . And we haven’t seen Manus Cranny. . I think the U.K. . we’ve seen over the last month is like an accelerated peak in the future. . And I think that’s that’s what we need to guard against. . John, if you believe in a hard landing, why not buy treasuries here? Huh? That’s a that’s a great question, and that’s another aspect of the current environment where the playbook, the typical playbook might not be applying. . We don’t think is going to apply. . We are going to see a recession, but it’s gonna be a recession. . The context where inflation is going to be under control and it’s a foretold recession. . It’s really the recession caused by monetary policy readied as a way by which inflation will get under control. . And as a result, when we get to that recession, you won’t see the typical reaction of yields falling and bonds playing the safety role. . So the typical playbook of go find refuge in bonds in this recession, I think won’t apply. . This part of the reason why perhaps the stability that you talked about, the surprising resilience of markets is almost a headwind to them because it won’t necessarily stop the rising rate environment. . It won’t necessarily change where we are in a wholesale value. . How high can yields go and stay for a prolonged period of time before something breaks in the financial system? So in our estimates, like if we go to 5 percent as now, we kind of assume for early next year, this is a world where we’re going to see a very significant slowdown of activity, decline activities 2 percent. . We think as a minimum of GDP, it’s 3 million jobs that will need to be lost in that context. . So in the world where 5 percent is sustained and I think in the world like this, the financial system leverage as it as it is, we’ll start to see some some response. . And that’s the. . So 5 percent is is where we’re heading. . We don’t think we can go much further than that. . That’s why over the course of the first half of next year, we’re going to see central banks having forced into some stopping pause before they can go further. . John, you said recession foretold. . I’m interested by that phrase. . You’ve also talked about the appropriate time horizon to bring inflation back to Target. . And I think you’ve explained conveyed your disappointment that central banks aren’t having that discussion a whole lot more. . Does it have to be this way? I think what is very interesting in the U.N. . and we we’ve written about this is the fact that, you know, there’s years used to be two sides to any decision in central banking. . Like it’s not typically obvious what you have to do. . And I think this enviroment is as tricky as it has ever been. . I mean, I don’t think there’s been any short, sharp tradeoff that we have to deal with. . You know, we have to go back to 70s. . And the 70s was a different situation altogether. . There’s a tendency to apply to apply the playbook of the 70s, but we’re not in the 70s. . And so this lack of two sided debate on what’s going to happen or nuance is troubling. . And that’s why we think that we are going to get over tightening. . That’s honestly the outcome that ought to be. . But I think it’s happening at some point, think that the pressure to force it will be pretty, pretty strong. . And we’ve seen that in the U.K., right. . I mean, we’ve seen the Senate version. . You go in one direction. . Markets will put some pressure and I think we’ll see some force pause. . That’s not great for credibility. . I think it’s better for central banks to be on the front foot. . And, you know, I’ve signaled that there are some nuances here we might need to deal with, but this is not the situation we’re in. . So I think we’re gonna be forced into, you know, a wake up call. . And and we’ll look at a pause, but one that has been forced as opposed to being quickly here. . And I could go for an hour with you on this. . There was a guy named Bernanke who e-mailed you when you were a kid and said, do you want to try for a speech at Princeton? You talked about it the day he won the Nobel Prize. . What did he and Anna Schwartz and Milton Friedman do? So we didn’t repeat a depression. . Well, I think the key lesson of the Great Depression that Anna Schwartz and Friedman at first, like more from an anecdotal perspective or documenting that the depression was. . And that Ben Bernanke and others have a more formalized was that if you tighten monetary policy as the economy is is is going down, you create this financial accelerator dynamic to the banking systems that we’re doing right now and with and with bank runs. . And I think that was very much in his mind when 2000 came out. . It was interesting in the speech he gave in 2002 in the anniversary of Friedman that he said, we heard you won’t do it again. . That was that was a reference to the Depression. . He thought he was abusing his status at the time, but not his future status. . He was he was he was a governor, but became chairman afterwards. . The thing, though, is that this time I don’t think this is the playbook. . This is not the playbook for the current situation. . This is not a demand driven financial crisis bank run story. . This is a massive supply shock that we’re dealing through. . I’m not sure that those lessons apply right now. . So that was, what, 2008 and the city for 20 20 and after the jump by van of BlackRock jump. . Fantastic to have you with us in the studio in New York. . Thank you, sir. . And we’re still trying to unwind some of those policies from the Bernanke. . Yes. . It’s amazing to see the ECB came out and had to basically come up with this new tool, TPA, that we had. . The Bank of England had to step into the gilt market. . We’ve had to be OJD that’s had to intervene in our facts in South Korea. . Earlier this week, some also had to do something on the credit side. . The government had to announce, make an announcement that said when I just want that t CAC. . We tried to step back from this era. . How many more times central banks will have to step back in? They’re going to be very subtle. . And you go from Damian says sorry yesterday to John Bell today in its extremely fluid right now. . John and I frankly think the original theories don’t work. . Here’s doctor events as it’s a supply shock. . Shock. . Would you like to be a central banker again? Do you fancy that? Not really. . No, I think the Montreal Canadiens didn’t think so. . Leave that to others. . Well, coming up on this program, Mary Barra, the chairman and CEO of General Motors, looking forward to that. . Matt Miller going to catch up with her in about an hour from now from New York this morning. . Good morning. . Well, this is pulling back. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Mateo in the UK. . Ricci Sue CAC has formally become prime minister. . Snake addressed the nation outside Number 10 Downing Street after meeting with King Charles a third. . He said that mistakes were made by his predecessor, Liz Trust, and he promised to place economic stability and confidence at the centre of his agenda. . The US won’t change its stance toward China as a result of Jinping seizing more power. . Advisers are still trying to set up a meeting between President Biden and the Chinese leader at the conclusion of the Communist Party Congress last week. . Gee placed allies in top posts and paved the way for a third five year term. . NATO was increasingly concerned that Russia’s desperation over battlefield failures in Ukraine may lead the Kremlin to escalate the war, and that could involve a massive attack on a target like a dam or even a weapon of mass destruction. . NATO says that for now, there is no sign Moscow is actually preparing for such an attack. . Adidas has ended its partnership with Yay! The rapper and designer formerly known as CAC West. . In a recent weeks, they has made controversial statements, including anti-Semitic posts on social media that stirred his easy line of sneakers into a lightning rod for criticism. . Adidas says that ending the deal would mean a negative impact of close to 250 million in net income. . And U.P.S. says it’s on track to meet its financial targets for the full year. . The package courier is trying to manage through a slump in peak season demand that has rattled the shipping market. . U.P.S. is third quarter earnings beat estimates. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . This is Bloomberg. . Don’t take a pause at one point. . Conditions around the road tell you it’s rational to take a pause because any three months doesn’t matter much. . But American consumers, eventually the excess money they have is running out. . That’ll probably happen sometime mid-year next year. . And then we’ll know more about what’s going on, gas prices, more kind of thing. . Jamie Time in the J.P. . Morgan CEO. . Hello from New York. . To monitor the price action, looks like this going into the open. . Empowered equity futures slightly negative through much of this morning. . We stay that we’re down a third of 1 percent. . Yields are lower by 7 basis points on a 10 year, 417 32. . Any affects market. . Euro dollar, slightly weaker. . Euro in the mix here, negative zero point once six per cent on that currency pound 98, 58. . I can tell you the Italian prime minister used her first speech this morning, guys, to lawmakers in Italy to absolutely slam the ECB. . How much of this are we going to see across Europe and across the United States? It’s a mystery. . We don’t know if the Federal Reserve. . We’ve seen it from Senator Sanders and Senator Warren. . You imagine we’ll see a whole lot more if the economy starts to roll over and unemployment in the elections as well. . And this is what Prime Minister Maloney had to say to the decision to raise borrowing costs, quote, is considered by many to be a rash choice, which runs the risk of impacting banking credit to families and businesses. . And Lisa, she went on and she went on Emma Chandra. . And how much of this is driven by that anger that austerity was really placed on Italy, was placed on Greece, was placed on some of these nations by the ECB, by the European region at a time when Germany is kind of front running some of this these issues. . I mean, how much is that part of what’s fueling some of the additional anger toward these policies? T.K., we’re going to see a lot more of this. . I think I think it’s fair to say and again, a chart is not my chart of the year, but close here is the measurement of the Bloomberg financial conditions in Europe is an absolute outlier. . Can’t say enough how restrictive their stances. . Given the mathematics and comments here on bond buying as well. . Here’s the quote for you that is compounded by the decision already made by the central bank to end beginning on July 122. . The program to buy back bonds on the open market, which creates further difficulties for member states that have elevated public debt. . Well, we will see. . And of course, through Thursday’s ECB, wrote Jihye Lee, it is very lucky for 75 from the ECB. . Yeah. . Oh, he’s an easy 75. . Then what? After that? After that is after the midterm elections. . Annmarie Horden joins us again, our Bloomberg Washington correspondent Amery at the White House. . And I guess the basic ideas of president yesterday giving pep talks and that what does the president of the United States do in the next two weeks? What he’s gonna doing is gonna do his best to try to rally Democrats to get out and vote. . Try to rally independents to make sure they’re reaching out as well to the youth vote, which was critical in the presidential election. . But also, Tom, you have to think he will only go campaign, of course, if those candidates want him alongside him. . You have very different views from some of these candidates that are really running in some of these tight races and critical races like John Fetterman in Pennsylvania has really embraced President Biden. . But then, of course, you have the Democratic Senate candidate in Ohio that has wanted to keep a very large wide distance from the president, actually looking at outreach to other members of his party, like Senator Manchin. . So the president is obviously going to walk that line. . But he’s going to continue to tout. . And he said this a few times yesterday, that the Democrats are fiscally responsible and that the Republicans want to do are mega, mega trickle down. . This is a line that he continues to say and I imagine the next 14 days that will only ramp up. . It goes to the apathy we talked about in the last hour. . What does the turnout look right now? I mean, I’m going to editorialize in the presidential election. . Mr. . Trump got more votes and he got the last time around. . But nevertheless, there was this huge turnout for President Biden. . Do you expect the same kind of dynamics again? Well, midterms obviously have less of a turnout in presidential elections. . But at the same time, you do have really important issues that are coming up on every single poll that may force people to want to get out to vote. . And obviously, that is going to be the economy. . That is inflation. . We don’t know what turnout will end up being until the very end. . Tom, you made a great point the last hour that do people even trust the polls? What we saw from the presidential election with former President Don Trump and then, of course, candidate Hillary Clinton, that the polls really got that wrong. . A lot of this has to do with the fact that there is potentially a bias that Democrats are more honest in polls and some Republicans actually shy away. . But we already have voting underway and there should be a robust turnout. . A lot of that also depends on a state of play of that election day. . The weather and things like that can affect whether or not people are going to go out and actually vote. . Enraged John’s point earlier, how much is a Federal Reserve becoming part of the electoral conversation in terms of them going too fast, too far and torpedoing the economy? I think for us in the financial markets and the individuals we talked to, it’s incredibly important, I think, for everyday Americans. . It’s not so much the Fed, but what the Fed is doing that is impacting their everyday lives. . So what does this mean for their mortgage rates? Is it actually taming inflation, having an impact on energy prices, a potential other prices going up, consumer prices like groceries and rent, but also the fact that does this mean if they’re going too fast, are they going to be blaming the Fed or like many do, blame the current administration? If we do end up in a recession, which if you look at Bloomberg Economics latest projections, it is one hundred percent. . It is basically we will be in a recession effectively at some point the next twelve months. . Dan RTS, Emory, thank you. . We basically heard that from jump out five months ago as BlackRock on this program in the shower. . It was 15 minutes, got some it basically said the same thing about next year. . The recession is already baked it. . That’s what you gonna get. . Or at least a slowdown. . Do we need a recession? I mean, I I’ve always been in the camp, John. . If you have 1 percent GDP, that’s not good enough for a huge body of Americans. . I don’t need an NBER recession. . What I have here is, is Dr. . BOVESPA mentioned is a massively restrictive set of central banks guessing due an economic slowdown. . This is they go to engineer the slowdown. . Isn’t that the problem, politically speaking, to Lisa’s question, to produce up to debt? I mean, the Columbia yesterday, I’m looking at the 10 year United Kingdom piece here now. . And it’s basically it’s basically back 13 years. . I mean, it’s a it’s a whole it’s Disney. . It’s a whole new world. . They said there’s been some some big losses in this market pick up on the destiny and the fairy tales. . It’s been out of someone in the markets for a long, long time. . And we’re trying to step back from that. . It comes with pain. . Well, and this to your point, Tom, you said that there’s so much pain in the bond market and yet jump over is not buying treasuries yet. . He sees yields going even higher because we still have it’s inflationary when it finished 5 percent. . Yeah, it’s a little fun. . Yes. . Citigroup to Anderson Harsh. . Just put this out, saying that home price data is going to show you do see a decline in housing prices. . But the wage data that we get in Friday could show upward pressure on inflation from wages indicating that wage spiral. . So this is the sort of push pull of where we are in inflation right now. . Can you make the argument that we’ve priced in the bulk of the rate hike cycle? If you look at pricing at 5 percent, then of course, you can probably make that argument. . Can you make the argument with pricing the consequences if that rate hike cycle? Tom, I don’t think anyone’s making the argument right now. . We’re also going to do a large recession. . Losses while we’re talking nowhere and nowhere else. . Yet the only in the world, six or seven standard deviation. . How that’s possible on UK, you. . Just ignore your colleagues. . I do. . I ignore him. . Complete just job shots at Rishaad Salamat has a six standard deviation ten year give. . You told him that? I told him that. . Live from New York City is the price action this Tuesday morning. . Good morning to you. . Futures negative a little more than a tenth of 1 percent. . No drama on the S&amp;P, on the NASDAQ, almost unchanged, positive by about a tenth of 1 percent after the close. . Later close to 18 percent called it about 18 percent of the Nasdaq 100 reporting in just two names. . Microsoft being one, Alphabet being the other will look out for that a little bit late. . So go to the close in the bond market. . So tense and 30, some say come with it. . Iconic Google, too. . I have no idea why I just called alphabet. . Towns and cities look like this in the bond market. . Your yield on a two year full. . Forty five. . Fifty six back on Friday. . We had a little look at 460 and then we backed away. . Backed away on some of the Fed speak. . The idea that we get this stepped down from seventy five days to twenty five. . We heard from Jordan, Rochester, Nomura. . He’s not looking for that step down. . No more. . And the team looking for 75 basis points for the Federal Reserve, this meeting and 75 basis points from the Federal Reserve at the next meeting. . One other thing Nomura and Jordan Rochester had to say was that the moment for him, certain currency pairs are getting a little bit boring and boring. . It’s welcome. . When you’re talking about Sterling Capel is where we say a little bit of outperformance. . The pound against the US dollar within 10 today, the pound right now at about 113, 25 and some. . I think we’re all hoping we get boring good quickly in the gilt market after we saw a move of more than 30 basis points lower at the front end of the yield curve. . Yesterday on Tuesday, the biggest one day move lower in about 30 years. . For governor, barely, John, it has improved, but the needles barely moved. . Let’s be clear. . The prime minister and his team understand those Bloomberg Markets. . We’ve got to be sure that the prime minister has a Bloomberg terminal at 10 Downing Street. . What he’s got is five, six, even seven standard deviation moves. . And that’s untenable. . He’s got to fix that. . And we’ve got to work out his chance to it’s going to be we assume it’s going to be Jeremy Hunt. . Got to fill out that cap. . That’s true. . He’s got to work out what the budget looks like. . And then for Governor Bailey, it’s over to the governor, right? The Bank of England. . Does he need to do a whole lot more than he had to the last time they met? And does he need to do less than he had to do maybe in about two weeks ago? Tom, a lot’s changed in the U.K. . in the last several weeks, that’s for sure. . Year to year in the U.K., about three thirty nine. . That’s the cross asset price action. . It’s got some single names we can do that with. . Lisa. . Lisa? Hey, John is affirming full year guidance. . The new beating of estimates. . That’s really the question that I have after some of the morning’s earnings. . We got U.P.S., forget General Motors, but with a firming up full year guidance. . Those stocks both popping more than 4 percent, nearly 5 percent for General Motors, four and a half percent for U.P.S.. . How much have analysts had traders downgraded some of their expectations? And Tom, you were talking about that. . They’re basically affirming or just making estimates is basically akin to beating in an environment like the one that we’re currently in. . Yeah, that’s you. . These are challenging stories. . U.P.S., I’m not going to conflate their 3M and GM, but they’re managing the message list every 90 days. . And what our viewers and listeners do as you look at shareholder return, which has been a challenge. . U.P.S. different than FedEx has actually provided much more negative guidance. . 3M, however, the second downgrade in terms of full year forecast based on F X headwinds, second downgrade this year, that is not really being received particularly well in the market, down two point four percent per ton. . This really speaks to what we’ve seen more generally since the earnings have forgotten, which is that misses are pondering and just affirming is beating. . And, you know, beats aren’t necessarily being rewarded if they don’t have any visibility that far into the future. . Thank you, Lisa. . Right now, good visibility on foreign exchange. . Joining us was really sharp knowledge, particularly one on your end today, George Servos, global head of VFX research at Deutsche Bank. . George, I’m going to pivot on you. . There’s six ways to go here. . I go to go to Thursday and the ECB meeting. . What will President Legarde do to the euro off of her decision to lift a presumed 75 beeps? Good morning, Tom. . So I think the answer is probably not much. . The 75 basis points hike is widely discounted. . It’s as you expected. . But critically, if you look at what’s been going on this year, currencies have not really been very correlated to interest rate differentials. . It’s been a lot more about the dollar. . Safe haven, risk premium. . Some of the very large geopolitical risks, whether in Russia or China. . So I wouldn’t really expect the ECB to have a sustained impact on the euro, which is something it has struggled to have for the last few meetings as well. . George, I they stop the growth outlook when it comes to Europe. . Just how fast do you and the team expect things to get in Europe and how quickly? Well, it’s interesting you mentioned the growth outlook, John, because if you look at the euro, it really behaves as a pro cyclical currency. . So for the euro to be strengthening, you need growth expectations to be bottoming out and then recovering. . I don’t think we’re at that stage yet. . We obviously got the PMI is just a few days ago with another downside surprise. . So we do have a recession in Pennsylvania. . I suspect it may not be as bad as some of the more extreme forecasts that are out there, because so far at least, the weather has been quite favorable. . So if you’re looking at the nat gas situation, the tension that seems to be easing. . But no question about it. . Europe is going through a sharp slowdown and that is definitely a big headwind for the euro. . George, given the developing trade dynamics, the structural shift in the way the energy is supplied towards Europe, do you see some kind of structurally weaker euro in the years to come relative to what we saw in the year before? I think you can make the argument. . The problem is it’s impossible to fully understand where the equilibrium level of energy prices are. . If you take natural gas as an example, back in August, we were essentially three times as high. . If you plug in the energy prices at the moment in terms of what it means for the external accounts, the deficit is going to be half where it was in terms of peak. . So I think there’s still huge uncertainty in terms of the equilibrium level of oil and more importantly, not gas prices. . But if they stay as elevated or go back to where they were during the September period, we would be talking about a structurally weaker level of the euro for sure, other to build on, which I’m saying we’ve seen a lot of turmoil in China as well. . And China has a bigger play on the German economy, the biggest economy in the euro region. . And we’re seeing foreign flows just flood out of that nation now at a record pace. . How much does that feed into this feeling that structurally the euro will be weaker and that this will lead to weaker growth in your region now and in three years from now? Well, it’s interesting that you mentioned China, because if you look at the renminbi, it’s now actually weaken more than the euro has over the course of a year, and this is without facing a war in the footsteps, so to speak, or as big of a negative commodity shock. . So the main point I’d make on exchange rates is the dominant driver has very much been the broad dollar, which has pushed currencies weaker relative symmetrically with the exception of the yen and extreme policy that I would say the combination of China weakness plus the commodity price issues in Europe do definitely point to more structural headwinds as far as European growth goes for the next few years. . You mentioned the yen and you put a note overnight that I thought was fascinating. . Basically saying it’s broken and talking about yield curve control and talking about the whole plan that Japan is trying to stick to. . Does this mean that you think we might not see some sort of massive breach, some sort of dramatic shift in policy that’s just going to be a slow burn as expressed in an ongoing weakening yen and not necessarily leading to this disruption on a global level? Some people were afraid of. . It’s a very interesting dynamic in Japan. . In some sense, it’s the biggest monetary experiment in history taking place. . But if you look at the dynamics for a couple of things that are worth noting. . The first one, as you said, is apart from those free bonds at the back of Japan, its targets and everything else is essentially decoupled. . So we’re no longer essentially in a hilltop control framework. . We’re just in a specific bond CAC framework for its specific bonds, but everything else. . If you look at swap levels in terms of swap spreads and the swap yields are implying everything’s already started to adjust. . The other point is the Bank of Japan now effectively owns the entirety of those or that near entire tier of those specific funds they’re targeting. . So the point is, even if the cap goes, the only institution that will face losses on those bonds of the Bank of Japan itself. . So I do think it will be disruptive. . But the way it’s being managed and the way the markets de facto control, in any case, it may mean it’s less disruptive than some of the more extreme scenarios that people are putting out. . George, you went back 40 years and there have been five, including this one, manufactured surges in Japan of inflation. . They’ve been manufacturing inflation up. . We go to 3 percent. . Inflation is there. . Inflation now is corrodes, inflation manufactured and is it a fiction? So so far, it’s been imported inflation and very high commodity prices have helped, the very weak yen has helped. . And what he’s trying to do and I think this is why people will surprised that it’s the first genuine attempt to shift the entire inflation regime. . He’s trying to make that feed into wages, into core services. . And if you look at the data, it is slowly starting to work. . So Core Services Corp. . is starting to move wider. . So maybe he will go down in history as the first Japanese central banker that’s able to move Japan out of this low inflation equilibrium. . And if that happens, I think it would be a very, very globally significant event in the sense that the last bastion of disinflation, so to speak, will have ended. . George, can I ask a stupid question? What happens when a central bank loses money? That’s a very interesting and important question. . I think the answer is fairly straightforward, at least from my perspective, not much. . So we already have the RBA, for example, running negative equity because they’re losing money as the price of those bonds people have gone down. . The Fed is is essentially also losing money on its QE portfolio. . But when we look at the balance sheet of a central bank, we have to remember it’s very different from any sort of private sector institution because the central bank prints its own money. . So, yes, there are discussions around loss of potential credibility that central banks would need to be recapitalized. . But at the end of the day, these are all balance sheet technical questions. . I think in practice, it doesn’t really mean anything they charge. . Wonderful to hear from you, sir. . As always, good to catch you up, mate. . George, south of Alice, they have Deutsche Bank out of London. . Isn’t a hedge fund managers dream, T.K.? What happens when you lose money? Not much. . So, yeah, I’ll let you tell. . That’s the size of the institution. . And I’m really at the heart of what Allan Meltzer did for years in history of the Fed. . They’re just that big where if they lose money, it’s one big. . So what I would state and occur out with a superb article today with a team General Ando and others worldwide on the challenge is that central banks have and I know I think it’s critical. . Then again, these the debt price movements I’m seeing are not normal. . I thought your perspective on Japan was really important. . I’ve often criticized the BMJ. . I’ve got the head in the sand operation ostrich chef when assets hike in their stock, that doing nothing. . I truly believe this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to reset inflation expectations higher and good luck to them. . Let’s see if this works out. . Equity futures right now are negative. . On the S&amp;P. . We’re down about a tenth of 1 per cent life from New York. . This is CAC. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Matteo Ricci. .

Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has declined to say whether he’ll run for president in 2024. .

Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Mateo. . This is Bloomberg. . I think the thing people really need to focus on the most is how long does the Fed keep that that funds rate really high. . So let’s say up to 5 percent. . We think it’s going to be a long time, six plus months, maybe a year. . That’s going to hurt equities. . We think that’s going to hurt risk. . That was my Schumacher. . That club had a macro strategy at Wells Fargo. . Fantastic catch out with him. . The attention turns from fixed income to earnings a little bit later. . Numbers from alphabet and numbers from Microsoft. . After the close, your market looks like this going into the open and found about one hour and 42 minutes away. . Equity futures dancy tenths of 1 percent on the S&amp;P. . Yo, it’s had a much, much lower now down nine basis points. . Tom, your yield on a 10 year for 15, 20 to watch yields and what price? Thank you for the huge response yesterday when I was going mental about price matters. . It’s not just about yield someone that knows that. . As Robert Tip, chief investment strategist, head of Global Bonds at PJM, where they’re really exceptional record of trying to find total return. . Robert, I look at the corporate, not the full faith and credit total return, but the Bloomberg corporate total return index. . And it’s something in the vicinity of a draw down of a negative 21 percent on price. . Do you just assume with Fed action that we enjoy bond prices lower and yields higher? I think the Fed is bringing us a gift here. . I think we’re having a regime shift and I think at the Fed, you know, the one that’s really been in the lead in the cycle is Bullard. . And I’m sure you remember his paper in 2016 about regime shifts. . You know, these markets, we don’t slowly go from this environment to that one. . And it’s a little bit different than six months ago, John. . And actually, we could be jumping back to an equilibrium that’s much more normal. . You know, the Fed funds rate the last 50 years has averaged 5 percent. . And right now, everyone is convinced that if the Fed does over four inches towards 5 percent, there’s going to be a hard landing. . But fear corporate bonds, if they inch over 4 percent and slow down and see how things are going. . There’s a lot of yield out there right now. . Long corporate bonds. . And it’s a real horse race as to whether, you know, those yields are peaking. . Those returns are a bottoming out here. . I mean, you have a nameless bond. . This is somebody’s reported earnings today. . Doesn’t matter who it is. . And they’re enjoying a four point one percent piece out 10 years, make it nine years. . And they’ve also enjoyed a 30 percent drop in price. . Robert, tell our listeners and viewers how they handle duration if they’ve enjoyed double digit losses in bonds. . Do you come in short duration or do you go out long duration to try to pick up coupon? Well, I think we’ve normalized here. . I think this is an environment where people are supposed to be at some kind of a strategic bridge position in terms of their asset allocation, and that includes duration. . I mean, we have been in a period driven by central banks targeting unnaturally high inflation rates. . I mean, it wasn’t that long ago, 20, 19, even in 2020. . Sure. . Paul was talking about 25 years of failure to get inflation up to 2 percent. . And they haven’t. . Interest rates are incredibly low. . But now that’s changed. . And with Covid, with all that terrible things that have happened. . One positive is they’re resetting interest rates higher. . And so I think that, you know, five, 10 years from now, when we look back, inflation will be lower than it is now. . Growth will probably be lower than it has been certainly the last couple of years. . And this will a bit of reset. . So whether. . Exactly. . You know, 4 percent, four and a half percent, five percent. . What’s going to be that peak level of rates? I don’t know. . But I think we’re in the zone of that peak in terms of interest rates. . But it’s not going to be an up and all the way back down unless something unforeseen happens. . This is a setup kind of like ninety four ninety five where rates go up, they stabilize. . Now that ends up boosting bond returns for the long run. . The bond returns perhaps in investment grade corporates as you are talking about, what about just in 10 year treasuries at a time when people are talking about normalizing at higher yields. . I think long duration, high quality, like 10 year treasuries. . It’s more balanced. . I think that, you know, if the Fed funds rate ends up going up to four and a quarter, four and a half, and the Fed at that point is saying, yeah, I mean, we’re kind of indifferent here, but we need inflation to come down. . And so if anything, that probably means that we maybe hike gap if that’s the case. . I think you’re going to have a little bit of a burn on the yield curve where those long yields that are lower than the short yields are going to be under pressure to move higher, to pay people compensation to take that duration. . Because of the uncertainty, to Tom’s point about price down in some of these corporate bonds that have coupons of 4 percent that were sold, say, a year two years ago and now have all in yield of something like 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent. . How much does that become a credit problem for these companies in a year when they have to start refinancing? Yes, so I think the whole dollar price. . The big dollar price changes, it creates mental problems for investors in terms of figuring out the right things to do. . And in terms of issuers, it creates less of a problem in the immediate future than you would imagine. . So on the issuer side, to your question, where it takes a long time for corporate debt structures, cost of capital to change the bonds, mature very slowly and they they issue and it’s incremental. . And if you’re in a world that’s going to support. . 4 percent 10 year treasury for the long run here. . That’s probably a pretty high nominal growth economy. . And they’re gonna get by. . But if it can’t be a plus now, it’s gonna be a negative, but it’s a very slow burn. . The dollar price thing for investors, you know, it’s shocking. . You know, when you have a reset like we had before, from very high yields to very low yields, you get a one time jump in dollar prices where, you know, your bond future may be closer to 200 than 100 and it stays there for a long period of time. . It doesn’t really have any bearing on necessarily where things are going to go. . I think that’s the case with a lot of these bonds that are now at very, very deep discounts. . If we’re roughly in the yields on that, we’re going to be and then they’re going to very slowly take their time moving back to par. . But I think, you know, that shouldn’t distract you from the real valuation question, which is, is the yield right or not? Rob. . Awesome to hear from you. . Robert said that if PJM fixed income on this bond market bonds today firmer, looking pretty solid, actually yields lower by 8 basis points on a 10 year to 416. . At the front end of the curve on TV is that five basis points to 4 45. . We need to talk about the earnings. . And for Q3 it was always going to be about the guidance. . And what we’ve had this morning was a razor hold holding account, a race from Coca-Cola, a hold reaffirm any outlook from GM and a cut from 3M. . Tom, a little bit early this morning, very mixed so far today. . Jason Kelly Anna Edwards talked about this yesterday, but she was stunning when she talked about one in five companies maybe have the glory of decent cash flow, decent margins, decent revenue. . That’s Coca-Cola. . I would suggest maybe it’s not even one in five. . It’s even more narrow than that. . And we’ll see that narrowness today with Google and Microsoft this afternoon. . You know, I can see at the corner of my just sort of loitering gown in the distance. . Matt Miller, can I drop by the studio and catch up on the GMC? I’ve got the answers to my bitcoin floating around is that they do. . They float around. . Float around. . Okay. . Let’s get tonight. . It’s at that depth, the knowledge, its analysis of crypto here. . Matt Levine out with a ISE or very holding Bloomberg Businessweek like a massive take on bitcoin. . I’ll read it because I’m there because it’s a room because Levine Then I see Matt on camera. . It’s great that a little package, you know, has a digital. . Finally, I’ve got time for Dow Jones. . How much should we panic? Tons. . Tons to finally get on camera for a crypto. . The day to day noise is exceptionally high right now, and it’s really disturbing for a lot of investors, this type of volatility is something that we think you’ll see still for the next couple of quarters. . I think there’s more work to do here before the Fed really believes that short rates are offering a positive real yield. . I think the thing people really need to focus on the most is how long does the Fed keep that funds rate really high? I think the time has come for them to take a slower pace of rate hikes and wait and see what kind of shape the economy is in. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene, Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . Good morning, everyone. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance, Jonathan Ferro, Lisa Abramowicz and Tom Keene. . We welcome all of you on Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg Television, the common theme of the earnings season from industrial America this morning John. . Right over to where we are with tech this afternoon is dollar ramification alphabet. . Microsoft coming up a little bit later in effects is a brand new excuse available to see. . It is worldwide and 3M is taking that opportunity to play. . Thanks, Tom. . It’s a real deal. . The dollar is a whole lot stronger. . And if you’re an international company that she had some, it makes a difference if you based here in the United States are some domestics. . Liz Ann Sonders with a great chart from Schwab’s showing that domestic company outperformance versus multinational international is well, the conversation Jordan, Rochester and George Savalas that we had earlier is just simply not about yen. . It’s about a holistic thing, the developing cum economies, the EMR economies, and there’s real dynamics out there. . Any company the rest of the world wants this fed to slow down the step down, no question. . A step the bling bling down 50 is that we are going to bleep down. . Nemo is not looking for that. . They reckon 75 for the next meeting and then another 75. . Then why do we all agree to it? We all agree 75. . I get it. . ECB and that to me, it’s the. . Then what? Well, and then at what point if they do pause, right. . Let’s say they do a step down and they get to four and a half percent. . Hold on a second then say anything. . I didn’t say it. . But if they don’t say anything, if they don’t do anything further, is the further path going to be another rate hike, as we heard from Robert Tip because of the inflationary pressure? Any call on the Fed is at the mercy of the CPI data and we get another CPI print Tom Keene a couple of weeks time. . And nation to nation, it’s a huge variance as well as jumbo events had earlier in June to stagger to the data here with inflation tied to the yield right now, 10 year yield four point one six percent, the real yield comes back from that 182 down to one 58. . Everything linked together off that key inflation report. . Yep. . And not just in Europe, in the United States as well. . Senator, time for this market worldwide this year and maybe beyond it to 2023. . Let’s wait for the price action for you. . Just briefly on the S&amp;P 500, slightly negative for much of this morning. . No drama, though. . We’re down about 13 on the S&amp;P with self-doubt by a third. . If 1 percent yields on a 10 year lower negative down 8 basis points on a 10 year to 416. . And in the affects market, T.K., softer euro here just a little bit weaker, 98, 63 on euro dollar. . If you’re a student of the Midwest and you had parents that were industrial on your college list was the West Point of manufacturing and engineering. . It was called General Motors Institute, now Kettering. . And never did they know that one of their students would come out to provide leadership for General Motors is Mary Barra. . And Matt Miller brings us to her today, the engineer from the General Motors. . And I’m looking forward to it, Mary. . Thanks so much for joining us. . Really appreciate it on such a busy day for you. . Let me pick up where these guys left off and ask you about the stronger dollar. . Obviously, the lion’s share of your revenue comes here in the U.S., but you still buy purchase a lot of parts in your supply chain from outside of the country. . Is a stronger dollar a tailwind for you? Well, I think, you know, there’s a lot of pressures right now when you look at commodity cost transportation, it’s just one of the elements and that we’re facing is not as significant for as it is for other companies, just based on our strong position in North America. . But we continue to to monitor and be impacted by each of these factors. . Rates obviously a huge factor as well. . We’ve seen it impacting other lenders. . And I’m wondering how it’s impacting GM Financial. . Where we are seeing GM Financial get back to you, I would say historically strong performance, I think we had especially strong performance last year and the year prior due to the strength of used cars pricing that’s coming down with interest rates, we are seeing a little softening on leasing. . But overall, GM F is performing very well. . You know, the CEOs of JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs both this morning have said they see a recession as likely for the U.S. . I’m wondering your view, you have a unique position. . What’s the economy look like to you? How. . How is it unfolding? And car sales specifically. . Well, I’m gonna let calling a recession to the economists, not to not my expertise, but what I’ll tell you what we are seeing and we’re seeing still very strong demand for our products. . We’re seeing strong average transaction pricing that we we continue to be able to build on. . And so we are starting to see inventory build just a little bit, but well below levels that were in the past. . So overall, we’re still seeing a very strong consumer for our products. . And, you know, we’re watching carefully all the different signs. . But right now, it’s still very strong. . But what about inflation and the pressure on margins? I mean, does the stronger dollar balance that out? Are you seeing a big inflation in rise in the costs that you need to pay out for parts? And is that sort of squeezing your margins here? Well, we have. . Yes. . We have seen, you know, commodities, logistics. . You know, we work with our suppliers to make sure that we have a very healthy supplier base. . So all of those factors we tend to work to offset and we predicted this year would be about a 5000 or excuse me, 5 billion dollar impact. . And we are seeing that. . But we have worked effectively to find offsets. . And that’s part of our overall equation for this year, which is allowing us to still maintain guidance. . One big boost is going to be the Inflation Reduction Act, at least. . UBS says they see the IRA as very generous. . They say it has the potential to make the US a global Eevee battery hub. . How do you see the Inflation Reduction Act for GM? Well, General Motors was already investing in North America or in the United States, for instance. . You know, we have a battery plant in Ohio that’s ramping right now. . We have two others, one in Michigan, one in Tennessee that are also ramping. . So we were making the investments because we wanted to make sure we had a resilient supply chain. . After we’ve lived through so much disruption over the last few years. . So as the ISE came into was passed and we’re looking now for Treasury to set the rules, we think we’re very, very well-positioned. . And we do believe that the benefits of Iowa are either they will drive stronger adoption with the American consumer. . So we think it’s going to do exactly what was intended to do. . And we’re well positioned to benefit and and work with our consumers to make sure they have an Eevee that’s affordable, that they can really enjoy the benefits of NTV. . Are you still on track to sell a million of these in 2025 and beyond? We absolutely are. . You know, when you look at the lineup that we have, you starting with the Hummer to the lyric to now that the Chevy Silverado, even we just last week launched the GMC Sierra. . Evey along with the Chevrolet Blazer Eevee and the Equinox TV. . I think we’re gonna be well-positioned covering the important segments in the portfolio to reach that million unit level by 2025. . You do get a huge boost also from big truck margins, and I imagine that helps you to fund the TV business and get towards that target. . If we have a recession and you see sales of those big trucks as big ISE trucks drop, can you continue to fund the easy boost? We very much believe where we have a strong enough balance sheet and the strength of the business. . When you look at the truck, we have truck leadership. . We’ve had it since 2020 and we just did a major refresh to our light duty, full size trucks. . We have strong SUV as well. . And now the heavy duties we just revealed they’ll be next year. . So we think our product portfolio is going to position as well in the truck market. . I would also say midsize crossovers are very strong as well. . And the truck consumer, especially the full size truck consumer, they generally are not they don’t shop as many segments as maybe other customers of other segments do. . So we think we’re well-positioned and obviously will moderate based on what happens from an economy into a consumer buying perspective. . You know, earlier this year, people were asking if we were going to get back to a 17 million SAAR. . Now I’m hearing people ask if we’re going to go down to a 12 million SAAR. . What do you expect for car sales next year? Well, we know because of all of the economic conditions around the globe. . You know, we are looking and we’re planning for a more modest level. . We’re still going to protect for the upside because we don’t know our next year. . But you know where it can really depress levels right now because of all the semiconductor shortages and other supply chain issues. . So we think there’s an opportunity to go up ever so slightly next year. . But we’re going to be very conservative as we plan for next year. . But be ready, Dad, to take advantage if there is upside and there’s still a lot of unknowns. . We’ll provide more information on how we view 2023 and early next year. . All right, Mary, thanks so much for joining us. . Real pleasure talking to you on earnings day. . General Motors chief executive officer Mary Barra. . Mark Gurman. . Matt Miller. . Just awesome, as always. . Tell me this. . I’ve been willing to ask this question for you of you for ages. . How green is a nine thousand pound Hummer? Avey Just how green is that? Well, I suppose in in what sense do you mean there are zero tailpipe emissions? So it’s so super great. . Right. . Talk about how much goes into making a now 9000 pound Hummer, 80. . Then tell me about how much damage that does to the roads. . Tell me about the tire wear as well. . How much rubber will need to put on these cars? Just how green are these vehicle? And when you have that, the life of the vehicle, the damage it does to the road, the new tires that you’re going to need? Well, a madam is here to argue with. . Electricity is generated by coal. . That’s a problem as well. . But I think that people like Mary and it across the industry are looking for solutions to the climate crisis that we face. . So, yes, there are problems you could see or you could make the argument that it’s not much more green than Silverado. . It’s even bigger. . It’s even heavier. . But at least they’re making some headway in that direction. . Wouldn’t I be better off buying a smaller gas auto that’s un-American seems dangerous. . Would you want to drive around in a small winter? Wouldn’t that be more great if I hit you in Michael Barr? This is the ridiculous part of this conversation. . Is this just a fad that doesn’t really address what we need to address? I think it’s a piece of a might get if you’re selling motor cars. . I get that clearly. . And you can get the credits from the government to do so. . Americans love the elephant in the room here. . Americans do love going about it. . Right. . We’re ready, guys. . What they like on. . You know, I hate to say you shouldn’t drive big trucks. . I’m just here to say that this green branding golf them seems to miss the mark a little bit. . I don’t disagree. . I don’t either. . T.K. . costs one hundred and ten thousand dollars. . I can afford it. . No. . Anyway, some snowfall is coming. . And our chief investment strategist says see if eight from New York. . This is pulling back. . And I love my Honda Civic for keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Matteo Ricci. . Soon, CAC has formally taken over as the prime minister of the UK sitting outside Number 10 Downing Street. . Soon, that promise to fix the mistakes made by his predecessor lost trust. . He said the UK faces a profound economic crisis and that will mean difficult decisions to come. . NATO is increasingly concerned that Russia’s desperation over battlefield failures in Ukraine may lead the Kremlin to escalate the war. . That could involve a massive attack on a target like a dam or even a weapon of mass destruction. . NATO says that for now, there is no sign Moscow is actually preparing for such an attack. . Adidas has ended its partnership with Yay! The rapper and designer formerly known as Konya West. . In recent weeks, B.A. . has made controversial statements, including anti-Semitic posts on social media. . Now that’s turned his Yeezy line of sneakers into a lightning rod for criticism. . Adidas says that ending the deal will mean a negative impact of close to 250 million in net income. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake, powered by more than 20 700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . This is Bloomberg. . What people say they’re doing with their money and what they’re actually doing with their money. . I still think the gap between those two things is quite is quite wide here that flows, for example, are still pretty aggressive in both equities and bonds. . Chris, for owner of Strategic ISE, can I just say with colder the air, you gave it to pre maturity day on a curve inversion. . I think up there is that cool from Chris on dollar yen looking for 150 when we were at 115 and we closed at 115 last Thursday. . Oh, go 15. . Yeah. . He was way out front on that. . Yeah. . He gave it to my. . Well Senator. . At least you’re not alone because Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley. . No one who’s long. . How bearish view on U.S. . stocks has materialized this year was ranked the best portfolio strategist in the latest Institutional Investor Survey. . Congratulations to Mike. . Triple limiting cash. . You should check it. . Award Palmer Cash Tom Keene. . I’m not sure if that warrants somebody from Governor Bailey’s team said how do you handle leveraged versus what we’re going to see this week from Biogen, a Bank of England and of course, the ECB on Thursday. . Please stay with us through the week on earnings and we’ll be talking about the afternoon earnings as well, such as Microsoft and Google today. . Right now, we readjust on the equity markets with Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFR. . Always good to speak to him. . Sam, Julian, Emmanuel, keep score on a daily basis in every core of what we see and what he sees as a modeled eight point eight percent revenue growth. . How do you with all your experience, your star system, it’s S.F. . are a what does eight point eight revenue growth or whatever the number is going to be. . How does that distil down through the income statement to free cash flow? And then on the share price. . Well, good morning, Tom. . Thank you for the easy question. . Basically, what we’re looking for this year, or at least in the third quarter, is a 10 percent gain in revenues for the S&amp;P 500. . And that compares with 2 percent earnings growth. . Profit margins likely to slip a bit about seven and a half percent. . But when you look beneath, in a sense, the surface, the 10 percent growth really is driven by the energy sector as well as the communication services, consumer discretionary categories. . CAC is really expected to show only about a 5 percent gain in revenues. . We’re seeing a theme of alpha of individual stock selection. . Is this a time is within tumult? Now, is this a time in the era of individual stock selection, sector selection or get out of the market selection? Well, I think that you one could say that we are getting to the point where we might be looking toward the market and sectors, because as you probably are well aware of, you know, the Stock Traders Almanac calls November through April the best six months of the year. . And my seasonal rotation strategy will switch from the defensive staples and health care to the cyclical discretionary industrials, materials and tech at the end of October. . So historically, we are in the best period. . The sweet spot for the market, October of mid-term election years through October of the year after I have posted an average total return of 21 percent since World War 2 and has risen 100 percent of the time. . Sam, was the distinction for you between a bear market rally and the beginning of more sustainable economic and market cycle? Kailey Leinz. . Well, I would tend to say that you’ve got to see some factors that really confirm that the move higher to make it something that’s more like the beginning of a new bull market rather than simply a bear market rally. . One of the things we have not seen is a sharp capitulation in a sense, the increase in volatility. . I look at a rolling 15 day average between percentage of high and low for the S&amp;P 500. . Normally we peak in a bear market environment above two standard deviations. . Right now, we’re pretty much hugging the average. . So the volatility, the fear, the capitulation has really not been there yet. . And I think we probably need to see that before we can say that this bear market is over. . So how do you view the whole step down that we’ve been talking about or this idea that the Fed could decelerate its rate hikes, which is one reason some people have given as a narrative to the gains that we’ve seen over the past week. . Do you buy into that, that if the Fed is compelled to slow the pace of rate hikes, that’s a positive for stocks? Well, I think if they’re compelled, it could be for for reasons that are more ominous. . We have seen since World War 2 that whenever we’ve had a year on year change and CPI exceeding six and a half percent, remember, we hit nine point one percent in June. . We have had not only a bear market, but also a recession and that these bear markets fell further and lasted longer than bear markets without recessions. . So I would tend to say that real concern is when we do acknowledge that we are in recession. . How deep will it be? And therefore, it was an earlier low in October, the low or simply a low. . And I would tend to say it’s a low because I’m looking for something closer to about 30 to 100 on the S&amp;P 500 that might end up toward the end of the first quarter of next year. . I sent. . Thank you, Sam Stovall of CSR. . Right. . Sounds like some semblance of this could go on for another 6 9 months. . Yeah, something like that, at least at the rally could in this sort of speaks to this idea that, OK, it’s a bear market rally, but let’s ride it. . Right. . How many people are basically saying that? Well, my most insane because they’re concerned that they get beaten up by being too bearish, at least in the near term. . Chris Howard-Smith once had it right the first time. . And then let’s put it forward. . I tell you what, this game is tough. . It’s not a criticism of Chris Epps. . I mean, he’s very clear about that upfront. . Chris was talking about the weakness in earnings to come in the first half of 2003. . He brought that forward. . And now it just feels like people are Christian to back out. . People are pushing it back now. . This cycle’s just moved at such a speed that so hard to keep up with. . I think people are still guesses that we saw a rise. . This is a cycle. . Well, someone did it again. . Is it two? Yes. . Or is it they tend to fall ISE back to what Jumbo Vince said. . It is completely away from any demand structure. . It’s in the textbooks. . It’s all pandemic supply side dynamic. . And that tells me it’s not a cycle. . It’s original. . What I’ve heard is that because we’ve only had a couple of years of this post pandemic, we haven’t at the time to build up excess. . And I guess, Tom, to your point, it depends on the starting point. . Do you think this thing began, started after the pandemic or do you include the. . Ten years before the pandemic as well. . Well, the people who said that there weren’t excesses in the financial system are the same people saying that this could be a slow burn. . That was Robert Tip. . That was jumbo VAT. . Basically saying there will not be the trigger for financial stability at rates at four and a half percent. . And that they could stay there for longer, which will reset the concept of corporate valuations and corporate leaders on Microsoft today. . And what I’m doing is just going back and comparing where we are now to 2019 preshow damage. . And that’s that’s the the elite group of equities that have been able to improve on that. . You look skeptical. . I just think what we’ve seen from central banks, we already seeing the intervention. . So this idea that it’s going to be this slow bleed, the police had to step back in and buy gilts. . The PIIGS had to intervene in the affects market. . The ECB had to come up with this transmission protection instrument. . That’s not been tested yet. . Talk about South Korea, similar story, obviously, but they’ve had to step back and do something on the credit side. . And I just wonder who’s next. . Okay. . Jacob Rees-Mogg just quit. . I speak news to. . 60 minutes away from the opening bell, live from New York City. . Good morning to you. . The price action shaping up as follows as we approach that opening bell equity features slightly negative on the S&amp;P, but down four tenths of one percent. . We are down 14 points, 10 of RTX this morning. . As for the guidance, you got a race from Coca-Cola hold reaffirming from GM at a cut from 3M after the close a little bit later, you’ll hear from Alphabet A Microsoft getting to all of that. . The bond market support, if you slow it down 8 basis points on a 10 year slump to four point twenty six percent in America right now. . Let us look at possibly your Book of the Year. . My Book of the Year for the first time ever. . I did it so early in the year on the shock of the war and Vladimir Putin and what we saw Putin’s world is my Book of the Year. . But look at this short, readable mega threads, mega threats. . Nouriel Roubini, crisis economics coming out of the crisis now this shockingly readable. . Nouriel Roubini joins us for the entire half hour. . I’m going to go back. . I want to give people a little vignette of years in my relationship. . We’re sitting in a wood paneled Davos like bar, and there’s a very famous secretary of treasury sitting somewhat near us. . And you and I walked through the excesses of 0 5 0 6. . And you nailed 2008. . Are we there again? Yes, we’re here again. . But in addition to the economic, monetary and financial risks and there are new ones now we’re going towards stagflation like we’ve never seen since the 70s. . In the book, I point out that there are also geopolitical risk like we are on a confrontation. . We have some revisionist powers like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea that are challenging the geopolitical order that the U.S. . and the West. . And that’s going to lead potentially to conflict. . There are environmental risks that are very severe. . There are health risks coming from pandemics. . And there is a relation between global climate change and pandemics. . There are technological risks coming from a machine learning, robotic automation, destruction of jobs. . There’s a backlash against globalization. . And we’re going to go to a world that is the global ISE. . There are political risk with polarization and where radical extremist party of the extreme right and extreme left coming to power both in advanced economies and in emerging markets. . And on top of it, we have amount of the debt like we’ve never seen before. . Explicit that, well, that’s what it is. . Right. . Where is the confluence of all these mega threats? Let us forget that Lipski at IMF was heated about the debt buildup on the back of your book. . You’ve got a guy named Rogoff from Harvard, Bremmer of Eurasia. . Dr. . El-Erian from Cambridge. . Martin. . Wolf, always wonderful at the FTSE. . And at the very top, the quote of the season from Taleb, The Gravity’s Return to the Physics. . We’ve got a higher real yield now. . We’ve got a risk free rate now. . What are the ramifications in our economic system that the gravity is returned to our physics? Well, there were many insolvent agents in the economy goes private and public debt as a share of GDP has gone from 20 percent to 350 globally between 2000 and today. . In advanced economies, more like 420 and rising in the U.S. . is now higher than after the Great Depression and after World War Two. . And we’re not out of a Great Depression or a major war. . And until now, even if you had zombie households, corporates, banks, shadow banks, governments, countries that were bailed out there were bailed out during the global financial crisis. . Zero policy rates, negative quantities of credit easing it even during the Covid crisis, many of them were fragile. . They were bailed out again. . We went back to get even more of the same this time around. . Instead, it’s different because we have so much debt and central banks like the Fed have to increase interest rates to fight inflation so that zombie institutions are going to go bankrupt. . That’s why not only we’re going to have inflation and stagflation, but whatever stagflation or that crisis in the 70s, we had negative supply shock 73 79, but with very low debt ratios. . So we didn’t have a debt crisis in advanced economies with one in Latin America, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil borrowed too much in the 70s. . All Volcker jacked up interest rates 20 percent. . They went bankrupt after the GFC. . We had the debt problems, mortgages, they had housing that bank that and where the debt crisis by was a negative aggregate demand shock and therefore we had lost elation and deflation. . Today we have the worst of the 70s with that massive amount of stagflation, very negative supply shock in the book. . Identify eleven new ones over the medium term and at the same time where that ratio like we have never seen before. . So we get stagflation. . That’s great. . Don’t give us the eleven themes. . John Tucker will be zero. . I was waiting for the 11th. . Did you use this phrase in there? I could tell you this in the sound bite about the left and I’m not going to give you said zombie institutions. . Yeah. . Where are they? And are you talking about countries now and not companies? Not households, not private balance sheets? Are you talking about country sufferance? Well, there are plenty of. . Is that in trouble in emerging markets? We know what has happened in Lebanon. . What has happened in Zambia? What has happened in Sri Lanka and there is about 40 of them that the IMF and the World Bank said that they are on the verge of having that crisis severe, that crises because of what’s happening. . And look what happened to the United Kingdom that now is starting to be placed in like an emerging market with the fiscal stimulus reckless, forcing the Bank of England essentially to monetize it, and then the currency falling and rates going much higher until they reverse themselves. . So it has happened in Greece. . It’s happening in the UK, could happen in Italy, of course, where a large number of not only emerging markets that are threatened, but also of advanced economies of various IBEX. . So over the last 10 years, we’ve had a series of countercyclical circuit, right? Yes. . Fiscal had the capacity to do that. . Yes. . Central banks had the capacity to do that. . Now, seemingly, we’re questioning the capacity of those institutions, central banks, sovereigns, to be able to do so this time around. . You offer solutions in this book to what are they? Well, for every one of these mega threads, there is a solution. . But then there are two final chapter one about a dystopian future where all these threads materialize. . They feed on each other. . And it is not just the end of the world economy could be even global war. . And there is a less dystopian future in chapter twelve where we have the policies nationally and internationally that leads us to a better outcome. . The problem is there are both domestic political constraints and geopolitical and political constraints to achieving the best solution. . And I’ll give you an example of global climate change domestically in this country. . Half of the country doesn’t believe in it, too. . There is a conflict between generation. . The young people care about the future of the elite class at the international level. . There is a free rider problem. . If a country cuts emissions to zero, nobody else does it. . Then they don’t get benefit then only the cost. . Not because of geopolitics. . Well, timing India and China. . You should cut their emissions RTS in the next 20 years. . We create the problem. . In the last 200 years, 90 percent of the stock of emission came from advanced economies. . Nowhere is that them don’t grow dumb, become rich because that is a problem. . It’s through the flow of new emissions coming mostly from China and India. . So there are four elements of conflict, two domestic and international that they essentially imply that we’re not going to find that ISE solution. . So there’s lots of greenwashing going, wishing, giving fig leaves. . Lots of CSG is just talk and no action. . Glasgow cop was just a total failure in or slow motion train wreck, which goes to your point, John, about electric vehicles and I around a vehicle. . It hasn’t happened. . Is in the United States because they’re green. . There is an issue, though, going forward where the central banks and whether a lot of your thesis scenario is predicated on their inability to go through with what they need to do to get inflation down. . Is that your base case? Is that the most likely outcome? Yeah. . Right now, all central banks are playing tough and talking tough and acting tough, hawkish because they have a problem of credibility. . But in my view, there are two problems. . One probably is that if they tried to get to 2 percent inflation, that caused a recession. . And this recession is not going to be short and shallow is not going to be gone, then it is not going to be claimed that he is not gonna be two quarters of negative growth. . Then inflation collapses and they can rise again in the book. . Explain all the reasons why he’s going to be a severe recession because of the debt ratio. . Because we are going into fiscal and monetary tightening. . And at the same time, you not only have an economic crash, you’re going to have also fiscal crash. . We’re not only in fiscal dominance in this game of chicken between Treasury and Central Bank, worrying what the folks at the Bank of International Settlement call a debt trap that is so much private and public debt that if central banks try to fight inflation, they cause a crash of financial markets and not just the stockmarket. . That’s the least important credit market bond markets and that crash and financial crash feeds on the economic crash and vice versa. . And therefore, they’re going to win power. . And they’re gonna blink. . And the first one was the Bank of England. . The Fed is going to do the same. . This is going to do the same. . Have you been surprised that we haven’t seen some sort of catalyst, some sort of financial stress so far, given how quickly and quickly the Fed has already hiked rates? Well, we have not yet seen it. . Some people worried there is some major financial institution not in the US may go bust. . I think that the financial strains are gonna become more severe because right now the Fed is on the way to go from 3 towards 5 percent. . You already have a stock market down 25 percent. . NASDAQ given more public reads 33 percent. . You have the crush of Mimi of spark, bubble of the creep, the bubble, private equity, venture capital growth. . Everything is down, credit is down. . Leverage, the market is shutting down, the yellow market shutting down. . And the only thing they used to be safe there were governance bonds. . Now the prices correlate that positive equities because when inflation is rising, you lose money and your equity side loses money on your bond side. . Yields have gone from 1 to 4 and the price action downwards on bond has been worse than in equities. . 30 percent losses or any 60, 40, 70, 30 or this part of the portfolio lost money on both hands. . There was nowhere to wait. . Even cash give you a negative real return because of inflation that alternatives they can protect against this tail risk, but they are not the traditional ones. . You’re a man of high conviction. . We know that. . You’ve also got some very smart friends get any pushback to this book that’s convinced you? Absolutely. . Anything makes you rethink how bad things might be and possibly made you think that possibly they could turn out better than you think. . Honestly, everyone was raided an any level as I. . The threats you’re talking about, they’re all too real. . Of course, that may be solution to them. . And I discussed them chapter by chapter in the final chapter about the less dystopian future. . But think of it this way. . I have gray hair. . I grew up in the 60s, 70s in Ian. . In Italy. . At that time, did I ever hear about climate change? A concept that worried about the nuclear ward. . After that, the town within Soviet U.S., there was nothing there worried about destroying most jobs, wearing the ISE winter with a stable democracy. . We didn’t have pandemics. . Last time around was 1918. . We had low debt ratios with law implicit debt because there was no aging population and all unfunded liabilities. . There were no major financial or economic crises. . This is a quantum shift. . There was a period in 1945 and the mid 80s that was something of a stable period global prosperity, welfare, peace and so on today. . These are threats that did not exist. . And those threats are more similar to the periods in 1918 1945 when with World War One, where were to get it, their passion threatened. . War. . Financial crises. . Inflation. . But inflation. . Deflation. . Nazis. . Fascists in Germany. . Italy. . France. . Spain. . And and Japan. . And World War 2. . And then where? The Holocaust? And then where? The Korean War? Yeah. . As as Neil Fergus on on Bloomberg is saying right now in his column this week, he says We’ll be lucky if you repeat the 1970s because it’s more possible we end up lagging, then came forth, meaning is talking about World War 3. . I love Neil, but can we be clear? That wasn’t a column. . That was a book on Bloomberg opinion. . Wasn’t if you read that he said it so long. . How low can you town, Neil? Columns are short. . I love this column because, you know, he’s speaking about it. . He’s speaking about the fact that it’s a meaningful chance that we’ve fallen, flicked and I write about in my own book. . There’s a chapter about the new Cold War between us. . And these are abusing his power. . And I say it could end up into a fatwa. . It’s a significant risk, no doubt. . Fantastic. . As always. . Know everybody’s going to stick with it. . I’ve got to go to go and get a drink after that and get ready for the next show. . OK. . And not be too depressing if you got a favorite quote yet in that book. . No. . You know, the last two lines lost to laugh because you know, why care? You know, I the last two words. . Our names are in it. . No, no. . The last one ISE of knowledge of is your name. . But the last two lines of the book is about the threat. . There we go. . We are Nouriel Roubini, staying here until, in fact. . Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Mateo. . Shares of UBS are rising. . The Swiss bank posted quarterly profit that beat estimates due to surging interest rates and cost control. . That will enable UBS to confirm a plan to return about 5.5 billion to investors this year. . And also deal liquidity in the market because there is a limit to what we can do. . Year today to last Friday, we were at four point six. . We will continue at the same level of speed. . So we should be getting certainly over the 5 billion towards the five and a half. . Commerce is leading the effort to boost automation, slimmed down management ranks and expand. . UBS has presence in US global news 24 hours a day. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . This is Bloomberg. . We likely likely have a recession in the US. . Going to have, I think most likely a recession, we might be in a recession. . And so until you get to that point that you see a change, whether it’s in labor, the demand side, you’re going to see central banks continue to move on that trajectory. . The economist from Goldman Sachs or Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, their point, talking, pontificating on a recession as well. . Of course, he’s got good advice. . Jan Hatzius, which helps as well. . Tom Keene Lisa Abramowicz. . We celebrate and continue with normal Roubini of Roubini Macro Associates, but far more of the new book must read mega threads. . I really can’t say enough about its terminus, its brevity. . It really is timely whether you agree with his caution. . And as he says very clearly, the final chapter of the book is how we get to an optimistic future. . I want to go to the past and I was so pleased that you mentioned on page 37 your colleague Alberto Alix Steel. . I still can’t believe we lost him. . It’s such a young age. . You two looked at the politics of our economic system, Roubini and Albert Alberto, our senior. . I want to bring it forward to where we are now, which is a massive dollar shortage in central banks. . They’ve got a plan, but they’re going to be overrun by a global dollar shortage. . Any. . And frankly, in developing economies is well. . Is there a dollar shortage now in is that the catalyst for central banks to blink is going to be one of the cartels? That is a dollar shortage. . And the reason interest is in United States is particularly dramatic for GM. . Labor terms of trade shock, those that are importing commodities, they have had a rise in interest rates because of what the Fed does and they have their own domestic inflation and the weakening of the currency that increases the real value in local currency over there on that. . So for them, it is a perfect storm. . Some of them have a lot of reserves. . Some of them don’t have reserves. . Some of them receive IMF money. . But that is right now, if it’s thinking of the dollar is implying even further tightening of financial conditions in the rest of the world. . Now, I think that eventually the dollar is going to have to fall very sharply because webre twin fiscal and current account deficits in other advanced economies, you have a fiscal deficit. . But if a current account surplus and now we’re essentially using the dollar as a tool of national security and foreign policy, what a weapon izing it. . We saw sanctions against Russia, against Iran, North Korea, China, where starting, by the way, the CAC war with China, economic water, these what will be sanctioned, the must for dollar weakness. . How do we get there? Forget about this plaza that goes bananas. . Laugh. . It is going to be essentially the Fed, the wimping out. . Once you see a severe recession ending up mean, that means blinking, right? Yeah. . Blinking. . They’re going to blink and wimped out because you’ll have a severe recession wimp. . I have a new financial mega threat out. . Well, either you are a hot hardcore, you are a wimp pencil or a dove in this case, but that’s gonna happen. . And once the Fed is going to essentially prevent an economic and financial crisis or tried to prevent it by essentially stop raising rates, even inflation is too high, then the dollar is going to start off sharply weaken. . That’s going to be the trigger for the raising of the dollar is, of course, the tight monetary policy. . A viewer wrote in and wants to know what you’re doing with your money. . Considering that it seems pretty bleak out there, you know, you just stuff it into a mattress. . No, you don’t stuff it in the mattress because then even cash loses money because of inflation. . There are three solutions to the problems of inflation the basement of fiat currency, political and geopolitical risk and environmental risk. . Solution number one is to have very, very short term treasuries that are just in ingrates and don’t have the price action of long bonds that they’ve had fall in their price. . Secondly, you want to be in two tapes, even if tapes right now have not yet done well because inflation expectations are not yet the young course. . I think you want to go into gold and precious metal again. . Gold has not done very well because you had tight monetary policy, a strong dollar. . But if central banks are going to blink and without gold, there’s going rise in value. . Those are the rising value also because they’re enemies of the U.S. . are subject to sanctions. . China and I was worried that a trillion dollars of reserves in dollar to move to other things. . If you’re in Japan, they can be seen as the only thing that cannot be seized as gold. . Of course, not in the vault in New York or London, but in Beijing or in Moscow and so on. . And finally, appropriate types of real estate that that environmentally resilient because real estate compared to equities in a recession does well because you have more pricing power for rents and so on. . So a combination of these assets provide you in a optimized way a hedge against some of these tendencies. . On the flip side, you’ve always been brilliant on leverage in the system. . Um, credit. . And we’ve heard from one fund manager after another that there is resilience in this corporate credit sector, even with the debt that they have, even with the low coupons that they’re currently paying, that will reset higher. . Do you disagree? Do you think that people are overly sanguine? And about the upcoming credit cycle. . Yeah, right. . Right before the Covid crisis, the Fed was writing reports on financial stability, pointing out the leverage of the corporate sector. . Of course, high yield and fallen angels. . But then during Covid, these folks should have gone bust. . But they were bailed out. . We bought even high yield that you remember commercial paper and everybody under the sun. . So these zombies were bailed out and the excesses of having leverage loans, seizure laws, cough light got even worse and people have got even more in debt that this time around. . The party’s over. . Because the Fed for now will have to raise rates. . Does that sort of situation got to becoming possible? You get the double whammy for those corporates. . You get a piano because income is going to fall because of a recession and you’ll get that problem with that servicing initial rising and therefore then being corporate debt crises, one way avoided during the GFC and during the Covid crisis is snoring. . Now they see a low in leverage or a market are shutting down right now. . I want to get to Chapter 12. . You talk about a more optimistic future, utopian future. . You started by quoting the economist Yogi Berra. . I thought that was very good. . You’ve got a write in there about predictions and Yogi in the future and all that. . How do you get from Yogi Berra to a more optimistic future? Well, the model optimistic future starts. . We’ve essentially technological innovations like, for example, I don’t think we’re gonna be renewable. . Maybe fusion fusion happens. . Then you can have unlimited amount of essentially energy, a cheap cause. . We’ve no greenhouse gas emissions. . We look like we are. . However, only 15 to 20 years away from fusion become a reality. . If it comes faster than we can increase the economic pie, we’re gonna reduce the cost of energy, going to stop greenhouse gas emissions. . We can grow more. . What about our fractured or fractured political system, whether it’s pure Italy in the turn there to the right or what we see in the election year coming up in two weeks, how do we get B on this fractured political system? For now, we’re going to go to a world that is even more divided domestically. . There’s more polarization, there’s lack of partisanship, and it’s happening. . I mean, you have authoritarian regimes in power. . You have Putin in Russia. . You have Erdogan in Turkey. . You have Kozinski in Poland. . You have Orban in Hungary. . You have meloni neatly. . You have these Nazi Swedish Democrats now in Sweden. . You have the Brexit phenomenon. . You have the Trump phenomenon. . And he Latin America used to be only Venezuela, Argentina, populists of the left. . But in the last two year old Chile, Ecuador, they rule Colombia. . He’s got to be either the right or the left. . Turns out a little less. . So that’s where we’re going, unfortunately, is a world that is not liberal democracy. . If you sold the movie rights, you know, not. . DiCaprio, who love playing Roubini nor Roubini, where there’s the book. . Is that Mega Threats? Maybe a documentary. . Yeah, exactly right. . Tony, dangerous trends that imperil our future and how to survive them. . Do we survive the day? Yeah, we did. . Well, it’s still it’s 855 a.m.. . So I think in New York City and we survive the day, we could say that coming up for you to be about. . There was very good, perhaps. . Richard Haass, when he comes on later, we’ll give us a sense of what mentioned by your Roubini. . Exactly. . Exactly. . And who read the book and gave it a huge endorsement. . He’ll be on Bloomberg Television later today. . He is, of course, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. . Good morning. .",

            "title": "[Finance English] Fed Day | Bloomberg Surveillance (2022.09.21)",
            "content": "Fed Day . We’re gonna see tightening through the back end of the year into the middle of next year and then quantitative tightening, QT continues in the background. . It’s unsustainable to have the Fed hiking rates at a very rapid rate doing QT with the economy slowing. . There is some thought that we’re getting to peak hawkishness but that’s not going to move the market. . Now the bigger risk than tail risk aspects are going to be really European energy crisis and how mid-term elections got this year. . Do you think the slowdown could be more significant. . Many economists are expecting this is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . It is Fed decision day Wednesday. . From New York City for our audience worldwide is not going to catch on is it. . Okay. . Good morning. . Good morning. . That’s more syllables. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance live on TV and radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz. . Some Jonathan Ferro features RTX third of one percent. . We’re looking for another 75 basis point hike later on. . Market’s very dynamic in his decision this afternoon starts drawing a dominant constant here in a moment. . John affects markets says it all but I’m sorry I’m going to push it aside for the real yield. . Everyone out there noting that finally the real yield matters and I’ll get to Japan slides. . So straight off the top. . The 10 year bond Japan’s hasn’t traded for two days for the first time since nineteen ninety nine. . Before we get carried away with the Fed Reserve the bank giving to the S&amp;P tomorrow the bee the gone nowhere it seems. . Well Norah 143 99 yen and maybe it ought to be at a 1 5 to 45 but everybody’s afraid they’re going to act to make yen stronger. . What it really speaks to John is what’s shifted in the last few days. . And I’m sorry this will infect the press conference this afternoon. . It gives way more than the major peers here against dollar. . That’s got to get everyone’s attention at the press conference. . It’s got our attention already in a massive way. . At least the amount of work this Fed has done in such a small amount of time. . Fed funds has gone from the middle of March at about zero to six months later basically at 3 per cent a little bit later on. . What’s that done. . Hike in 75 basis points. . We went from the end of 2015 zero. . Three years later we got to 2.5 per cent of Fed funds. . Just think about how much it took last time over three years over three years to get there and this time about six months to do even more. . So are we there yet. . I mean I think that that’s the question. . People are looking for some kind of answer. . How high are they going to go. . What’s their dot plot. . People like to be looking at that even though inside a cringe and feel like this is a completely moving target and doesn’t give you any real information. . But nonetheless people will be targeting it and it’ll be guiding the markets post a Fed meeting. . But how much can we talk about a 4.5 percent Fed funds rate a four point seventy five percent Fed funds rate as we heard from Bob Michael Barr on your show yesterday with JP Morgan Asset Management. . What was fiery. . Yes he was 4.5 treasuries. . He’s talking up 750 basis point spreads. . And he’s basically saying wait for the recession have patients. . We’re not there yet. . Wait for until then. . Big cash position was interesting to me is he flicked at the divergence within his own team when it comes to credit when it comes to the fact that finally getting Yellen to times real yield point to the fact that you’re getting 8 percent on credit he’s having. . Just wait right to your point John. . It could go up to 12 percent because we have not been in a recession. . And this really shows how difficult this situation is for investors who really haven’t seen this scenario for decades. . He talked about generational divide within the bank. . He said to the people that lived the 1980s on the trading floor had a very different opinion about where this was heading compared to the natural bank coming out of the financial crisis. . John ISE strikes a bit. . Dog is strongly strongly agree that there’s a generational memory here that a lot of people don’t have. . It’s new territory for a huge percent of our viewers and listeners. . Let’s get into this market right now. . Futures up by about a third of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P 500 on the NASDAQ 100 up a tenth of 1 per. . So many messages this morning about Fed day performance over the last 18 months. . This from the Bloomberg team. . The S&amp;P 500 index has risen after eight out of the last 10. . Decisions. . Lisa I think a lot of people are aware of that now. . And I wonder what that means for the Fed day performance today. . Yeah I wonder if people are going to look past this one to perhaps half a month a month after which tends to be quite different considering that people usually take two weeks to really understand what Fed Chair Jay Powell actually says because he usually has come out with hawkish proclamations and people don’t adjust until they realize oh wait they’re serious about it. . So we’re going to get something of the same today at 10:00 a.m. . Here’s what I’m watching. . Bank CEOs including Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Brian Moynihan of Bank of America as well as others are coming to Capitol Hill to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. . A lot of this will be trying to get some sound bites for different advertisements for different political candidates. . But how much do we get a real assessment of how much inflation is biting into the average consumer. . We are going to hear a lot of questions about inflation. . How much do we get a sense. . Yes of course the politicians are going to ask the banks what can you do about this. . But how much do they give a sense that really there is hurt that is spreading more rapidly than perhaps the real time or lagging data really as capturing today is there too at the U.N. . General Assembly. . I will not call it anger. . I really agree with you touched on and I actually was struggling with how many mistakes we were discussing anger and whether that’s an appropriate denomination just now. . You know I kind of agree. . President Biden is speaking at ten thirty five and he’s meeting with UK Prime Minister Liz Truss at what 15 PM. . What did you call it. . AC It’s going to be frosty. . Yeah it’s going to be. . There’s some I do. . I’m just suggesting it might Dani Burger. . They’re dealing with certain issues are having to deal with Northern Ireland. . And a couple of other issues and of course her plan that she’s unveiling isn’t necessarily ingratiating her with a lot of economists certainly locally in the United Kingdom as well as here in at 2:00 p.m. . there is the FOMC rate decision. . I hear it’s FOMC rate decision on Wednesday followed by a press conference with Jay Powell. . Real yield. . Yes. . But the dollar dynamics are really telling. . And John we’re seeing the dollar strengthen to the most going back to 2002. . Yes. . This is a Europe story with the European situation getting a little bit worse at least in the perception of the IBEX market. . How much does this cause real disruption. . And I’m going to be focused on that. . What a shock. . Lisa thank you. . Appreciate it. . Joining us now just a fantastic lineup today and it will climax with former vice chair Rich Clarity a little bit late so we can kick things off with Dom Constant right now. . They had a macro strategy at Mizzou of America’s Dome. . At the epicenter of your work you’re expecting inflation to fall and fall so much more quickly than people expect. . Don why is that your position. . The main thing on the inflation side is that you have profit margins expanded through Covid and are still very very high which means all of the cost inflation has actually been passed through house prices and then prices have gone up even more because of that expansion. . And you can break it down in the GDP data and show that for 10 percent inflation about 4 percent or so is cost and about 6 percent is due to profits actually expanding. . So that actually means a soft landing is actually still likely because companies can sort of cut back on those profits and still bring down inflation without necessarily having to fire people as rapidly as you might otherwise think. . And what they end up doing is they end up tolerating very weak productivity relatively strong employment. . You can still get lower inflation and it’s a soft landing. . Ironically though it’s just a bit tougher to get inflation down. . You need to work on obviously tightening financial conditions and raising real interest rates where we are now. . If all central banks are exposed by definition what is their best their most efficient best policy. . Given the stochastic nature of up inflation and the sharp disinflation. . What’s their best practice right now. . I mean this is tough. . I mean it’s tough for me is partly in the US for example the housing market obviously a lot of people locked in interest rates you know. . Okay. . They’re not gonna be moving house but you know interest rate impacts on slowing spending when also there wasn’t very much equity extraction in the first place. . Just makes it all very tough. . I think it’ll take time. . I think time is probably what you need. . And the Fed is finally only just really moving through the neutral rate now and getting restrictive. . So I think the message from the Fed is policy rates and real rates. . Yes those are the things they need to get up but they have to keep them there which is kind of the message. . So it’s not really a story about zooming them up aggressively and then reversing. . It’s more story about getting to a steady level of restriction and just being patient and trying to convince people that they’re taking the medicine for their own good and things will at some point normalize. . Just how lonely do you feel in your soft landing car right now. . Very good actually. . I mean it’s soft landing. . Doesn’t mean the Fed doesn’t have to raise rates and doesn’t have to maintain rates. . And the curve could stay very inverted for a while. . What it means is that the employment losses if you like are somewhat capped as inflation comes down. . And so you might well see unemployment rise to 4.5 5 maybe in 5 5 percent. . But in the end inflation really ought to come down quite a lot. . It doesn’t mean you have to take unemployment significantly higher and unravel everything that kind of was achieved in the post Covid period. . Dani Burger. . I was just wondering how much pushback you’re getting and whether you think that a hard landing whatever that means maybe higher unemployment maybe negative GDP growth whether that’s baked into equities and then you should go a long risk because you have a more optimistic view than the rest of the world. . Well I think I mean I think the the hard landing story kind of links to you know very deep losses in real GDP and obviously a very sharp increase in the unemployment rate and a kind of collapse in profits. . So the soft landing still gives you a very weak GDP maybe not as weak. . I mean you could be bumbling along zeros and small negatives. . You just don’t get the big increase in unemployment. . You just get the very bad productivity growth in the back of it and profit margins on the main thing they come in. . But I just look at operating earnings and say look if if in the peak they might have been over 200 they’re going to trend is like 180. . They come down towards trend but a hard landing that come much lower. . So it’s not great news for equities but it’s not a complete disaster. . So that’s the way I’d put it. . And and financial conditions you know are going to stay tight for a while. . So it’s gonna be a bit frustrating. . So there are nuances to the differences between hard and soft. . Thank you for joining us today. . Customer at Mizzou of America’s brand. . I mentioned that Chairman Powers addressing the news conference won’t stand anything like what we just heard in the last five minutes. . Probably not. . He’s going to talk about the need to get it rates higher that they’re not that close. . They’re going to keep going perhaps halfway there perhaps less than halfway there depending on whether J.P. . Morgan Asset Management or perhaps more than halfway. . If you’re taking a look at some of the pushback that they’re going to hard he’s going to have to come out and be hawkish. . Otherwise massive undermining and credibility and bearish on the economy potentially. . Chairman Power talked about the pain talked about the pain in that Jackson Hole speech time. . I went back over it last night. . And in that paragraph those couple of sentences where he talked sentences we talked about pain. . I just wonder if it’s captured by the forecast today because in a previous round of forecasts it wasn’t really it’ll never look at the forecast. . You know John I don’t believe in the dark plot this time. . It matters. . I make an exception for Allison. . Michael McKee will break that down. . It really matters a lot. . It. . Are you going to be looking at the dark like Tom. . No the case will not be looking at the dark. . That doesn’t matter. . I consider a. . Mistake but John the forecast today really matter. . I’m proud of it. . Thank you just for opening the summit. . Can I just tell you you’re so on on UNGA. . It’s disgrace. . And it reminds me of the Blue Swede redo of B.J. . Thomas hooked on a feeling 30 50 years ago where they open up Hugo. . You know what you do when you talk about a complex that accompanies that team mate that band. . I’m not going to go Chuck go. . You really not believe that I’m even a it inside of me. . Yeah. . Is a disgrace. . It’s the United Nations general as well said some. . Thank you. . So what. . I suggest that I take charge. . Good to have you back. . Features up two tents from Haiti. . OK this is pulling back. . Tom Keene Mack in full force keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . Vladimir Putin declares it a fight to the death with the U.S. . and its allies. . He is calling up three hundred thousand reserve troops in a major escalation of the war in Ukraine who also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons. . He said that the U.S. . and its allies want to destroy Russia. . A Ukrainian counter offensive in the last few weeks has dealt Russian troops their worst defeats since the early months of the conflict. . The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates today to the highest level since 2008 and it’s likely to forecast that there will be further increases for the third straight meeting. . Policymakers are expected to raise rates by 75 basis points. . Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to stress the Fed’s resolve to curb inflation. . That’s near a 40 year high. . The Bank of Japan is trying to cap upward pressure on yields before a policy decision later this week. . The central bank announced an unscheduled bond buying operation. . The OJ governor Rico Kuroda has emphasized his determination to maintain rock bottom interest rates even though many other developed nations are increasing them. . British Prime Minister Liz Truss reportedly will cut the rates of stamp duty for home purchases. . That’s according to the Times of London. . The newspaper says stress will announce a measure Friday as part of a budget to stimulate the UK economy. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake. . I’m Lisa Mateo. . This is Bloomberg. . Such votes referendums do not have any legitimacy. . Therefore they don’t change the nature of the conflict. . This will only further worsen the situation. . Therefore we need to provide more support for Ukraine. . Jens Stoltenberg the NATO Secretary-General with Bloomberg’s Annmarie Horden from New York City this morning. . Good morning Tom Keene. . Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro counting down to a Fed decision with equity futures just about positive up a quarter of one per cent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq up a tenth of 1 percent. . Yields coming back from multi-year highs on a 10 year DAX basis points 353 77 a dollar stronger euro dollar some negative a half of 1 per cent 99 25 as the Russian leader mobilizes even more troops. . Years ago I was on the bottom of a hotel in Chicago with Gloria Laureate Thomas showing the giant of game theory and war. . And one of the six people here simply said the doctor Schelling. . How two wars in nowhere like this morning does this matter with us. . Annmarie Horden here in the game theory of Vladimir Putin you have a wonderful history here based out of London of studying Russia. . You went to Vladivostok on my right down there and a few others long ago. . How do you respond as a journalist to these threats of nuclear war from Mr. . Putin. . Well I think he’s just upping the ante yet once again. . I mean we’ve seen him do this already before this threat of nuclear weapons. . But clearly he is making this move as he sees Ukrainian forces make inroads in Ukraine. . They went from they were able to capture. . I mean we’re talking about the size of Delaware Rhode Island level of Kiev. . Now he is going to have these sham referendums in Donetsk Rouhani. . This is the Donbass region. . He said he always wanted to have and then her side and zapped region that will connect him to Crimea. . And by doing that he is calling up reservists. . And this is how he’s making a play to the Russian people. . And at the same time telling the West I am prepared to take it to that threat level that would make everyone incredibly uncomfortable. . Every single military expert I have spoken to says it’s just a threat. . He would never do anything short term medium term long term nuclear issues. . I’m not an expert on it. . Every single guest says it’s unthinkable. . But we’ve had we’ve been at that spot before haven’t we. . Right. . And he’s done the unthinkable. . Right. . Not everyone also thought including President Lansky that he would even make inroads into Ukraine the way he did. . What I would say is and this is on background from someone who really understands the Russian apparatus had told me that the reason why he does not think Putin would ever go for the button on nuclear weapons is because he is not sure if his military would carry it out. . And at that point his reign would be over. . Anne-Marie a lot of people are talking about the European response the potential United States response to put up the potential for there to be for example jets sent over to Ukraine as a possible response to an escalation by Russia. . How united have people seemed in your discussions at the U.N. . General Assembly Council. . Well at this moment they’re incredibly united. . And what else can you say. . Right. . Putin is having sham referendums. . And then at the same point he’s telling all of the West to be on guard. . Do not call my bluff. . Those were his words last night. . So what you have is the United States the NATO secretary general all of these countries all of shots all of these leaders especially on the bilat having bilat this week alongside the U.N. . General Assembly having an An. . And this gives it almost a new impetus to have that fresh unity that for all of this week going into this meeting the big question was whether or not they’re able to remain united going into the winter. . This almost forces their hand to make sure they can make that case to their own economies and societies. . I’m looking right now at natural gas prices that ticked higher on the back of this news. . You see Brent crude ticking higher on the back of this news. . What’s the case for why that is really happening given that a lot of the bad news has already been accounted for and priced in. . Well just more geopolitical risk if there’s a if there’s a nuclear war on the markets. . Obviously this is something the markets are watching. . They thought potentially at some point there could be peace negotiations especially when you had Ukraine making up some of this territory in a very successful counter-offensive. . So this is just going to add to the geopolitical risk. . Also we need to really unwrap what is going to happen this winter in Europe and what we’re hearing right now. . Overnight Germany has taken unipolar. . They nationalized it. . I spoke to the Qatar foreign minister yesterday. . Schultz will be in Doha on Sunday. . They are still trying to make sure they have enough natural gas to get them through this winter. . And obviously the following in the following winter. . I am just thinking about the president’s address a little bit later this morning. . Do you expect him to address some of these issues. . Hundred. . The president is really going to make his speech about something we’ve heard him talk about before democracy’s verse autocracies and he’s gonna talk about the quote naked aggression. . According to his national security adviser Jake Sullivan briefing reporters yesterday in terms of what Russia is doing in Ukraine. . And here’s something else the president is set to do. . He’s set to talk about the principles that work for all countries and that pushes back against aggressors who seek to threaten course and intimidate their neighbors or to violently attack them. . He’s likely going to call out Russia which is on the Security Council which makes you question can the U.N. . really do anything. . It’s a very good point. . Annmarie Horden here in D.C. . and I thank you for the U.N. . General Assembly. . This tweet just came at some moments ago from Horseshoe laughs on Twitter. . I agree with your detest of the UNGA acronym. . Yeah the doctrine to call mature institutions by their proper name. . So you’re going to stop calling Tom Keene CAC now. . Oh no no. . You can call me NIKKEI John Micklethwait. . You are mature but to say this is a sure thing. . My mother called me T Kirk so I frankly loved it when I hear T.K.. . My mother called me T.K. . My father called me you John. . Team coverage in London. . It was very important that all of us were steeled for what went on with the show drama of the funeral the mourning of a weakened line. . And you know frankly I had to drill deeper into the culture of London. . And so I migrated north Annmarie Horden helping me out here on the move up. . And oh my word it was team coverage from London. . That was your view. . That was my view. . Larry King. . This is a John explained the majesty of Mr Sun coming in and scoring three goals in like 13 minutes. . That’s how you get a player team to fight. . You put them on the bench and then you bring him off the bench. . NIKKEI summit affair. . Even he had something to prove and those first two goals in that hat trick. . So we’re just absolutely awesome. . Can you describe the moment Tom your first English Premier League. . I loved it. . I teared up except every bartender and cigar bar. . I went to their Arsenal fans. . I don’t I don’t understand why a game to go to some 6 2. . Yeah. . Complain about low scoring games and you got 6 2 game is your debut appearance. . Yeah it was fascinating to see. . I saw the VAR in action which I still don’t understand. . I saw penalty shortstop that was taken back and on and on. . But what I really saw were the British people. . It was it was stunning. . John Micklethwait when they sing God Save the King. . It was just like to go on say it. . Best sport in the world. . Best board in the world. . Thank you Tom. . Mr Leavy I really like the actor just absolute after me not the world. . A song Paul Allen. . No I’m on board. . Okay. . Thank you. . Go Spurs. . Thank you Spurs. . Thank you Arsenal. . Now he’s going to start back at the top with the Spurs. . Life from New York City this morning gets more and it gets the price action on this fat decision day features positive by quarter of 1 percent on the S&amp;P. . You’re all familiar with the statistics of the Fed day decision price action blend that breaking them down for you in the last 10 Fed decisions eight of them. . This market has rallied and you’ve seen some big moves so far this year. . I got to push back against that view this time around. . The NASDAQ positive by just a tenth of 1 percent in the bond market massive changes at the front end and a yield curve on Taylor Riggs right now. . 395 25 came very very close to 4 percent in yesterday’s session. . We started the year at about 76 basis points twelve months ago. . The 2 year was at 21 basis points. . We even started the month at about 349. . We just keep adding more and more weight to the front end to the curve. . It’s been the theme so far of the year the 10 year old side. . I think this is the eighth consecutive week the yields have been climbing 350 377 on a 10 year. . Yields come in just a couple of basis points. . It hasn’t just been the United States though. . Well let’s take a global snapshot. . What’s happened to the global bond market and look at core government bonds exclusively. . We can take a look at a 10 year Treasury bond 300 basis points year to date a 10 year bond. . Remember on a 10 year bond we started the year in negative territory. . We’re now plus 200 basis points to about 188. . And some you’ll notice something that sticks out like a bit of a sore thumb for the. . Okay. . Oh this is barely a 10 year change ATP because they’ve kept that thing capped Tom at around 25 for radio right now. . This is three point five. . Germany one point nine. . Japan zero point three. . And John it really speaks to the impossibility Japan is in its state. . Can they keep setting this out. . Can I keep saying this out as the pressure continues to build and we’ve been exploring this in the last week or so. . What would happen if the BMJ abandoned that yield curve control story to the rest of that bond market bought. . It’s just it’s just it’s got to be played out through its foreign exchange and you’re seeing it. . And what has happened here folks in the last two or three days is again yen has not gone 144 45 right now. . Tougher Yvonne Man 143 90 stabilizing in the 1 40s. . Tom is probably not what they are. . How can fall through the rest of this year. . Very good. . We will continue here right now and with the Federal Reserve coverage today and look for us this afternoon we’re really ready for this was Michael McKee of course in the press conference. . Peter Hooper joins us now to say he’s global head of economic research at Deutsche Bank. . Barely describes his contribution to economics and how he and David focus land led in research in this crisis. . I’m going to state. . I may be wrong on this. . They discuss recession first. . Dr. . Hooper thank you so much for joining us today. . I want to go to the Deutsche Bank reach and particularly the work of Michael Spencer in Tokyo and the Pacific Rim that you people have done for decades and decades. . And I just wonder simply when I look at E.M. . currency give way on this day of the Federal Reserve for Chairman Powell is he going to be overcome by events. . Chairman Powell is got one mission that to do with inflation certainly is putting pressure on other countries but strong dollar is adding to inflation pressures just about anywhere you look at this point. . But that’s not going to deflect. . Chair Powell on his mission. . We’re going to hear a hawkish message today. . Probably going to drive the dollar further. . Is it a hawkish message towards neutrality or are we at an even general equilibrium. . And today do we become restrictive. . Now 75 basis points today is not going to put us in restricted territory given where inflation inflation is. . Given how tight the labor market is. . My my colleague Matt was there. . He did a great piece last week indicating why we need to get close to 5 percent. . You have to add not just the inflation picture but but the tightness of the labor market that Howard has been talking about as being central to this inflation problem. . I mean labor market we’ve seen the NAIRU running above 5 percent in the five and minutes given given all the various indicators you look at the tightness of the labor market we’re just way beyond the norm on a lot of different metrics not least of which is where look where wage wage inflation is now. . Peter that call from Matt last week we’ll read that piece close to 5 percent on Fed funds. . Let’s stick into that. . The pushback that I got when I put out that research on behalf of you guys and a lot of people sent messages to Lisa to my staff to Tom and basically said how on earth can we live with four and half nevermind five. . What does the economy look like with five percent Fed funds. . The economy is going into recession here. . We’re not expecting it tells the middle of next year perhaps a little sooner but that’s part of the way you’re going to have to ease up on this labor market in order to ease up the labor market. . You can’t bring down vacancies by themselves. . Historically it’s never happened. . You’re going to have to see the unemployment rate go up. . It’s going to have to get above 5 percent in order to deal with inflation with the inflation problem we have here. . So you know financial conditions have not been helping out until until we get to the reversal in the CPI for the August numbers. . But we have further to go. . And the Fed is going to have to push harder. . It’s going to have to get up into a restrictive range which we think is certainly a 4 percent plus for right now. . Peter it sounds like Deutsche Bank has been getting more bearish generally on the global economy as well as how far central banks will have to go. . Earlier this morning at your bank put out an estimate for European GDP revising it downward to negative two point two percent for next year from zero point three percent of a decline basically a deeper recession in Europe. . Have you had the same kind of revision to the U.S. . view based on how far the Fed has to go to stymie inflation from here. . Well so in Europe the European hit hit not just by the inflation problem and tightening by the ECB but obviously the cut off of Nord Stream wine has had a major impact. . We revised our growth rate for Germany down from 1 minus 1 percent to minus 4 percent next year. . Mark Wall our chief economist for Europe as you say put out a very nice piece this morning indicating the spillover from Germany and the rest of Europe being somewhat affected by the gas cutoff is enough to certainly put us in recession. . Now that that is a modest negative for the U.S. . but it’s certainly not enough to put Powell off course at this point that the inflation problem is going to be there. . It’s going to continue in this tight labor market continues until we see some some real slowdown in the U.S.. . Peter I guess I’m trying to gauge the depth of the recession that you see in the United States. . You do say a 5 percent in a real neutral interest rate. . You also are looking at unemployment 4 above 5 percent. . You’ve a sense of the duration not only of how long rates will stay there but also of how long we will be in a negative growth higher unemployment kind of environment. . Well we expect growth has slowed noticeably in the first half next year. . I mean part of what’s happening here is we’ve seen this rotation of spending from goods where production was ginned up substantially. . Now that’s shifting over to services. . Inventories are running up. . We’re going to have to see some inventory adjustment first half next year which will certainly begin to slow things down. . Then we think that this war chest of savings that the households is supporting the households will begin to run down enough for consumer spending to begin to begin to slow by the middle of next year. . We’re anticipating negative growth for the second half next year minus three and a half percent at an annual rate in the third quarter. . Another negative not quite as deep in the fourth quarter. . And then beginning to come back in 24. . So it’s a relatively moderate relatively brief recession. . The Fed begins to reverse course on its rates because it because that slowdown is going to help bring inflation down and allow it to reverse course. . Something that’s not in its current forecast at this point. . Peter is the recession spread evenly across America. . Does a certain part of the public face the Deutsche Bank recession call and others can escape its grasp. . Well it’s is always a way if you will. . I mean there are a wide wide range of income distribution and certainly lower income households. . We’re gonna be hit harder. . We’ll be hit more on the job front. . That’s the unfortunate part of this. . But I think given the recession is going to be consumer driven that will tend to be more broadly based than something that initially a big housing crunch. . But yes this will be a broad based recession. . It’s not going to hit all some big kills in that paid a fantastic way to work the rate work at Deutsche Bank over the last few weeks in fact for most of this year. . Peter Hooper the Deutsche Bank Securities Tom that call on narrowband somewhere close to stunning 5 per cent. . Right. . I wonder where the Fed is on that and what it means for their unemployment projections that ultimately need to factor in higher unemployment get inflation lower if he believes it’s close to 5. . That’s a lot of work to be done. . Not then they reject of another time and place. . And I argue and all you need to know is the first two letters are not accelerating. . It’s the quiet point is calculated with some unobservable data points. . It’s something people enjoy flunking on economic exams. . But it’s the quiet point you have to get to to get the slowdown done. . And to have it above 5 percent is something a huge body of people have never experience. . I wonder whether at least they’re forecasting because you ran the Fed’s got unemployment three point seven twenty three three point nine. . They’re going to 24 a four point one. . They don’t have the luxury of young you Lazare of UCLA and Deutsche Bank. . They’ve got a spin a message if you will. . This is true of every single institution. . Folks have got to spin a message that’s appropriate and gradual with Deutsche Bank. . There’s a suddenness to it. . And those forecasts are set to be updated later a little bit later this afternoon. . I want to see what they are. . I especially want to understand how high they expect to have to go because of the resilience in the economy. . And every different analyst who I’ve spoken to has said that right now this economy has been able to withstand higher rates better than so many people had expected because companies had termed out debt because individuals hadn’t taken on as much debt because people had locked in fixed rate mortgages. . All of these things that make it a less easy transmission of monetary policy forcing the Fed to go further. . How are they going to recognize that and how that’s going to put forced their hand with a lag effect that we can’t really see right now. . They are the two major questions right now. . How much higher rates need to be to bring down growth and how much slower growth needs to be to break down inflation. . That’s going to be a key feature in a conversation around the Federal Reserve a little bit later and a key feature of our conversation with the former vice chair Richard Florida. . Joining us straight after the Fed decision. . And then he’s gonna stick around for the news conference which I just think is incredibly cool. . It’s gonna catch up with us after the news conference with Chairman Pound and break what he thinks down ISE a gallon on some. . It’s going to be fast. . And what an honor to have him here. . He’s the academic from Columbia with massive monetary shock. . First question for me John has to know. . Are they making it up as they go. . You will get the first question of two tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P. . Live from New York this is pulling back. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . Vladimir Putin is threatening to escalate the war in Ukraine even further. . Putin is calling up hundred thousand reserve troops and vowed to use all means necessary to defend Russian territory. . He also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons. . Meanwhile the Kremlin is moving swiftly to annex parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. . The feds ready today to hike again and to send a hawkish message for the third meeting in a row. . Policymakers are expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points. . That would bring rates to the highest levels since 2008. . Chair Jerome Powell is likely to hammer home that he believes further rate hikes are needed to tame inflation. . European Central Bank President Christine Legarde says borrowing costs will rise more in the months ahead. . Speaking in Frankfurt Lagarde said the ECB has taken major steps to tackle inflation and she expects to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings. . The special master in the Donald Trump documents case is skeptical of some of the former president’s arguments. . Federal Judge Raymond Dearie pushed back on the Trump lawyers position that they didn’t need to detail any alleged declassification of highly sensitive records. . He said the Justice Department had presented evidence that several of the documents were classified. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Mateo. . This is Bloomberg. . We saw such high increases due to speculation over the geopolitical situation and some of the other issues that we’re now seeing a kind of backing off of that. . I mean I think one hundred and twenty barrels 120 dollars a barrel was too high for the supply demand situation. . And so we’re seeing that back up. . But into catch up with Anna Edwards senior fellow at the Atlantic Council a lot from New York this is Bloomberg counting it down to a Fed decision with equity futures just about positive up a third of one per cent call it that quarter of 1 per cent on S&amp;P up a tenth of 1 per cent on the NASDAQ 100 yields lower by a couple of basis points 353 77 euro weaker euro dollar negative a half of 1 percent to 99 26. . I can tell you the Swedish currency is getting absolutely battered again for a fifth straight session. . Weaker against the U.S. . dollar. . Might sound leftfield but just give me a second. . Some the BRICS bank count yesterday with a 100 basis point blank and we’re still getting currency weakness. . City Tanaka’s of City published just moments ago and he said a continuation of the sell off in risk assets due to the eurozone. . Strong economic headwinds and the Fed’s tightening path will maintain significant pressure on both the Norwegian currency and the Swedish currency as well against the dollar. . And many of these central banks Tom they share the same concern at the moment. . It’s going to be the bank having this turn tomorrow hiking into a slowdown and struggling to get any traction in the affects market. . You have to look the paper up Joan. . It’s a good 25 years old a brilliant paper from I believe the Peterson Institute. . And John it’s about watching 30 and 40 currency pairs at once. . That’s a little hard to do. . But there is a value to looking at Nike Starkey or a dollar Swede and the rest. . I mean you’ve got to look at all these pairs dynamically. . Do you have a guesstimate of where we’re going. . There’s a similar experience at the moment some against the U.S. . dollar that’s for sure. . And sending the Federal Reserve is not their problem. . Yes everybody else. . I just wondered some for how much longer that might be the case. . For those of you unfamiliar DAX. . Why is the core an ancient index. . Bloomberg Dollar Index is better math one ten point five seven and D X Y is a shock and particularly a shock to the nations of commodities. . CONOR Hick joins us now head of research at EDF Man in his just brilliant on the soft something we don’t talk enough about. . CONOR the impact of a strong dollar on commodity nations commodity. . E.M. . how large is it. . Huge huge I mean if you think about only six months ago when the war began in Ukraine. . Everything went up whether it was energy grains. . They all went up. . And that was because it’s highly inflationary then inflation may start in the US mid to high end U.S. . dollar. . That U.S. . dollar then caused that whole commodity elevation to just come collapsing down. . And now we’re back to pre-war levels. . So you had a dollar impact on commodities a very intact and reinvest and invest correlations as intact as ever. . My training used to always pivot to Indonesia and Brazil on dollar strength. . Are they of interest. . Well yes Indonesia will save palm oil massive producer oil exporter and coal is low until Brazil. . I mean take it from a soft commodities. . You cannot underestimate the impact of the Brazilian drought on all of these commodities. . So what we’re seeing today is the strong dollar is causing to be around to weaken. . That in turn is putting pressure on things like coffee sugar soy beans all the major Brazilian exports iron ore even. . But it’s not just that. . I mean I think today commodities are reacting. . They were positive initially because of the inflation story. . But now they’re coming off because the inflation story has moved to a recessionary story. . And obviously that’s not great for commodities. . Worse for metals and energy arguably less so for soft. . But it still it still isn’t. . It does have a dampening effect. . Sure. . The focus so very much on the energy story especially for Europe as they face off with a potentially catastrophic winter depending on the meteorologists reports that we get. . I’m wondering from your perspective if the answer is what Germany is now doing which is to nationalize energy companies does that help support things any more concrete way or does it just basically put a Band-Aid over the actual bill at some of these countries are facing. . Yes. . So I think in my opinion it’s a Band-Aid because the reality is that none of this is providing additional supply. . So we have a supply demand mismatch right now and the energy crisis. . So we either take our demand. . So you have to ration demand. . And I can’t see Germany effectively rationing the demand. . And suddenly in the UK they’re actually subsidizing the demand. . That doesn’t even talk about some things on the supply side. . I’m thinking I don’t see them investing or allowing more natural gas to come out. . So I don’t see this as fundamentally altering the situation too much. . And I think this this can go on for a while with us. . When you say this can go on for a while there is a question of how much has already been priced in in terms of what is to come for this winter. . And then there is a question as John’s highlighted many times of the duration of how long how many years we face off with this lack of supply in the face of demand. . What’s your view on both of those. . So with time you know humans are very negative and markets are adaptive. . So with time what’s going to happen is as long as prices continue to provide this pain pressure you will stop seeking adaptation. . So you will move towards alternatives when your body will become more efficient. . So that’s definitely what will happen with time overnight. . You’re not gonna get that. . So I think it’s fake to me. . What you are saying is we need that pain pressure to continue for a little bit. . You want more turf to materialize these kind of actions. . Only then when we start seeing a proper diversification both in terms of demand and also supply so we can stop relying less on natural gas relying less on Russia and even rely less on Ellen. . GM understanding that the LNG carriers on the streets are going through the roof. . They’re struggling to get hold of ships. . So it’s a multitude of problems are not going to be fixed overnight. . This is going to take a while kind of hack that of 80 and F man. . Thank you CONOR as always. . Several winces maybe Lisa perhaps even longer. . And for many officials in Europe I think that’s the reality they’ve got to confront. . The problem is is that each nation has its own energy situation its own energy crisis. . It’s completely different. . So how do they come up with a cohesive plan especially when you have such differing political interests heading into this winter. . It’s really complicated. . You’re seeing that expressed to the euro. . But a homebase for me I know have birth funding UK situation. . Fascinating. . Time to see what this new prime minister’s got to take in the UK and this new chancellor as well. . That punish some very interesting things. . A lot of people are worried about housing prices at the moment and they’re now looking at cutting a transaction tax when you buy a house term. . So let’s see what happens there. . They seem little and there’s sort of sprinkling them out of course off the shock of the death of the queen and a new king and a new government as well. . But John a pregnant question here. . Does she have the support of her party to shift the support of the country till. . That’s the big question. . I think she’s got the support of her party right now and the party membership. . If that went to a general election would she get the mandate to do the kind of things that this party is going to do to let the coming months. . Let’s frame it as we did with Peter Hooper in decline. . This is not year to date but very close. . I took it from the peak year in January or February. . ADX way down a good amount. . JP Morgan Emerging Market Index down is well they’re done 8 or 9 percent. . And then John there’s the emerging market of the United Kingdom down I believe 17 percent. . Having a very difficult time yet today. . That’s for sure. . Futures positive let’s call it a quarter of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P on the NASDAQ up a tenth of 1 percent. . A Federal Reserve decision just around the corner. . And they’re set to hike interest rates again by 75 basis points. . From New York. . This is pulling back. . We’re going to see tightening through the back end of the year into the middle of next year and then quantitative tightening Kuti continues in the background. . It’s unsustainable to have the Fed hiking rates at a very rapid rate. . We’re doing duty with the economy slowing. . There is some thought that we’re getting to peak hawkishness but that’s not going to move the market. . Now the bigger risk than tail risk aspects are going to be really European energy crisis and how mid-term elections does this year. . Do you think the slowdown could be more significant. . Many economists are expecting this is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . One more big rate hike just around a corner perhaps even more than that. . A life from New York City for our audience worldwide. . Good morning. . Good morning. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz. . Jonathan Ferro features positive a quarter of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P T.K.. . The consensus view another 75. . Coming right up. . There it is. . And then what will happen after that. . And as Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank told us this is just neutrality. . This is not a restrictive Wednesday. . You may get that in the last two meetings of the year. . But I think John all agree that even with this move today we’re nowhere near finished and then we get the forecast. . Will they forecast the risk of a hard landing in the U.S. . economy. . No they will forecast in a measured gradual way. . They’re a public institution and they’re number one they’ll never say it. . But the number one goal is to control the message and not instill fear. . They’re not going to go to the fear that we see from so many houses. . Elisa the chairman talked about that pain in his Jackson Hole speech. . He talked about pain that might have to develop to get inflation back down. . Will they capture some of that pain in that summary of economic projections. . That’s going to be something people are looking for for the credibility of the Federal Reserve not just for the United States. . I’m curious if they reflect the pain being felt around the world how they’re gauging the international influence on the United States when they start to care about the dollar. . They’re probably not going to talk about that but that has to be a niggling point on the outskirts of Jay Palace mind considering some of the pushback they’ve gotten for the likes the World Bank and the IMF. . Bank of England tomorrow Swiss National Bank. . Tomorrow they have a convening as well. . At the moment Lisa tough spots for them. . Those three and maybe more so for departure. . How about this for signaling they actually engaged in an unannounced bond purchasing program overnight to support the yield peg where it is. . You haven’t a trading in Japanese bonds for two days. . The first time has happened going back to 1999. . It is not a market. . They are doubling down. . And it’s sort of surprising to me the yen hasn’t given away to new weakness bottoms. . Right. . We were talking about this earlier. . He said people are scared to go against the Bank of Japan to go against Japan and Japanese resolve to keep things where they are and potentially up and everything if they change that. . But right now wow what an outlier and what a ticking time bomb that really is. . Staff to date him to two days to the Japanese 10 year government. . Bond has not traded for two days to translate this for non sophisticates. . They are doing a theory. . It’s no different than China’s doing with Covid. . They’ve got a theory but there’s no published background. . Richard Clare and John and all of the studies in Illinois under his excellence at Columbia never has read a paper that shows that theory can work on market central planning. . Let’s see how it works out. . Futures positive a quarter of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P. . Good morning. . She will Carnegie dance with fat decision. . With futures on the Nasdaq up by almost a tenth of 1 per cent yield to lower by couple of basis points to 353 97. . That has not been the trend. . It’s been your attire your attire your time on a two year lease. . So we came very close to 4 percent. . People really expecting a lot from this meeting but also beyond. . And that is the reason why the dot plot might matter to some people why it could move markets significantly at a time when people want to understand is this Federal Reserve moving close to the Deutsche Bank projection a potentially close to 5 percent neutral rates or end rates for the Federal Reserve. . All right. . 10:00 a.m. . bank CEOs including Jamie Diamond of J.P. . Morgan and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America are heading to the hill there and be testifying before the House Financial Services Committee. . A lot of theater. . Curious to hear what they say about inflation how it’s affecting consumers consumer lending. . Are they getting more restrictive in how often they are lending considering the fact that potentially people are going to have a harder time paying it back in the face of higher prices for basic day to day costs. . Today is day two at the U.N. . General Assembly. . Traffic is sufficiently. . It completely clogged up in New York City. . President Biden will be speaking at ten thirty a.m. . and then he is going to be meeting with UK Prime Minister Liz Truss at 115 PM. . Here is to hear how that meeting goes. . Not just because of some of the tensions with respect to Northern Ireland as well as U.S. . Britain. . British trade policies but also this pushback about some of her fiscal policies. . Does he address what she’s doing. . Is there some sort of coherence with the U.S. . support of the United Kingdom. . Heading into also a potentially difficult winter at 2:00 p.m. . this is the main event the FOMC rate decision followed by a press conference by Fed Chair Jay Powell. . A lot of questions. . You were talking about John whether he’s going to acknowledge some of the weakness that may be required according to some people if we get inflation down or for getting inflation down. . I’m watching the dollar. . We’re looking at a dollar that is the strongest going back to 2002. . Yes this is a euro story. . Yes this is a British story. . But this is also very much a Federal Reserve story. . When do they start to care about this is not a positive in reducing imported inflation but a negative John. . Because what it does to the rest of the world will eventually rebound in some form on U.S. . corporations as well as just generally the U.S. . economy. . I’ve been enjoying the steady traffic report when you continue that. . Do you want that. . Sure. . I mean if we really keep going down the track. . Right. . Yeah. . You said you have you know definitely barriers on the road. . There are barriers. . Dump trucks tumble. . John I got out. . I got out. . But when you let me out eight blocks away from our office here in midtown and the police stopped me. . And of course I had a tantrum. . I said do you know where I’m at. . No. . Did. . They put me in a police car drove me out to the George Washington Bridge who said Walk. . See you later. . See. . Do you know who you know who I am. . That’s such a t CAC doesn’t burn up by the George Washington Bridge. . It’s beautiful. . On the way to New Jersey. . Tom Mackenzie. . Yeah it’s about to walk back to our office here as a if you look at Englewood Cliffs. . I did. . I was like over there. . OK. . I’d like to talk about the Dow alone. . OK. . All right. . Oh my God. . You know they to what they do. . Yeah I’ve heard they talk about it a lot on that side of the bridge. . I’ve got no idea why futures are up on the S&amp;P. . But by T 10 measures up. . I mean Larry Hines joins us now global CIO for Street State Street Global Advisors. . Larry 75 expected today. . That’s what you’re looking for. . Can you guide us to November. . Do you expect to get that done. . It’s today. . Well it’s going to be hard to define what November brings because the Fed continues to be really focused on the emerging data. . So I think that they’re going to keep their cards close to their best. . We think that 75 today is almost a certainty. . And we actually do think that 50 is more likely for the balance of the year. . But the problem is that as long as they keep seeing this intractable inflation pressure for the data they will be compelled to act more decisively. . Larry where do I hide. . I mean stays true to such a fabulous institution on sector analysis factor analysis diversifying into subsets and what not to do. . Where do I hide if I’m worried about what not to do right here. . Well the best place is cash and for the first time in many many years. . Cash is actually giving you a bit of a return. . So in our globally diversified portfolios we’ve actually taken that cash position to about 10 percent. . And interestingly we’re not just taking it out of the equities we’re actually taking out of bonds as well. . So we’re a bit more balanced in where we’re underweight. . Laurie can we develop that a little bit more. . Which bonds are you talking about. . Duration 10 year 30 year Treasury yields. . Because you see those yields even going higher from here. . Or are you talking corporate credit in the face of some sort of downturn. . Yeah actually much more focused on corporate credit and being a bit underweight there. . We’re sort of neutral duration curiously enough but it’s a bit more barbell. . So cash plus long duration because we actually are concerned that we will have a much more aggressive fed and that will create a much more contractionary than recessionary environment. . That again is not our core call but work conditions that we have a little bit of optionality if we’re a little bit off on that Larry away from your room. . But let me go there to the income statement. . Are there dynamics or control blocks down the income statement earnings or free cash flow. . Or is this really about a diminished revenue story. . Well at this point in time we don’t feel like corporations are necessarily under pressure. . They’ve got relatively large caches of cash. . They actually are navigating the inflationary environment pretty well in terms of being able to pass on some increases to consumers being able to reconfigure their operating models and things of that nature. . So we’re in oh by the way in the high yield indices especially we could actually be on the verge of some upgrades because we had a lot of downgrades as we headed Jacobus. . So they’re actually the fundamentals there are not particularly prickly. . The problem is until we know what terminal rates are on the Fed Plaza it’s hard to know how to discount those future cash flows. . It’s the equity market. . Until then just totally unbearable. . The reason I ask this Larry is it just seems to me every time we rally get a host of people to say this is not the Fed not what the Fed wants. . They want financial conditions to remain tie in with cap to the Fed purchase. . Now a Fed Co. . Now when does that change. . Well curiously not but I was a little surprised to see this as well. . We’ve actually seen net inflows into equities. . So you still have had people dipping in buying the dips. . Perhaps it’s some of it’s rebalancing because of course equities and bonds have been down but actually equities have been down more. . But it’s also a little bit of this fear of missing out again because what we all know is that at some point markets become a leading indicators of future economic growth. . And so if we do have a recession or a contraction at some point we get past that. . So it’s still a very unsettled market in the range of outcomes is quite large. . Larry I know that a stay straight. . Larry one of the best. . Thanks for being with us. . Thank you very much. . At least that’s the problem a lot of people have with this market. . Remember David Kostin of Goldman Sachs coming into the summer who’s basically just said we’ll be kept it through the summer. . The Fed’s told you the playbook. . They want tight financial conditions. . That means an equity market account running too much. . I hear that Neel Kashkari has been watching that very closely. . Nina basically set the climate to outlast didn’t he. . On the did not. . Yes I was in town. . And Tracy Alloway basically said look we actually would be happy to see stocks sell off a little bit more. . Well we get the same kind of message from Jay Powell today. . Does he comment on financial conditions accurately reflecting or perhaps not reflecting as much. . What they’re hoping to achieve. . Could I just suggest as a fossil that if you get rates back to where they are and has not seen Taleb said brilliantly in the last number of days you know what we’ve been living is physics with our gravity and we’re finally back to gravity some form of risk free rate. . John can I suggest life goes on like you know rates go up then. . Pete spin in trust. . I’m with you. . We talked about adapting and adjusting yesterday. . Did you just because you went hey so we thought we’d bring it up. . You know there were so many world leaders lined up at Gatwick I couldn’t get down with it. . And I just think yeah got to get going. . I’m not a big fan of Gatwick. . I’m not either. . The drive was Amanda Lang Gatwick. . I had three cars with me. . It never had fits. . It took a month to Kate’s account with the surveillance. . Wondered who then goes up. . Sun goes down. . Companies adapt. . Wilson’s going to talk about that. . Yes sir. . It’s going to start in a justice sketch in a May delay. . The interview is going to join us in 50 minutes now from New York. . This is pulling back. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . Vladimir Putin declares it a fight to the death with the U.S. . and its allies. . He is calling up 300 thousand reserve troops in a major escalation of the war in Ukraine who also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons. . He said that the U.S. . and its allies want to destroy Russia. . A Ukrainian counter offensive in the last few weeks has dealt Russian troops their worst defeat since the early months of the conflict. . The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates today to the highest level since 2008 and it’s likely to forecast that there will be another increase. . Now for the third straight meeting policymakers are expected to raise rates by 75 basis points. . Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to stress the Fed’s resolve to curb inflation. . That’s near a 40 year high. . The Bank of Japan is trying to cap upward pressure on yields before policy decision later this week. . The central bank announced an unscheduled bond buying operation DOJ. . Governor how did he go. . Kuroda has emphasized his determination to maintain rock bottom interest rates even though many other developed nations are increasing them. . It’s the latest foreign takeover of a British tech company. . France’s Schneider Electric has agreed to buy out minority shareholders in industrial software company Aviva Group. . It’s a deal that values VEBA at ten point eight billion dollars. . Schneider already owns 59 percent of the VEBA global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than 20 700 journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . This is Bloomberg. . Howard policy regarding China on Taiwan has not changed. . We adhere to the one China policy. . Having said that we are concerned about China’s stated ambitions course of behavior. . There is no reason to threaten Taiwan in the way that China does. . Fantastic conversation with Jens Stoltenberg the NATO secretary general and Olympics Amari Hotel and life from New York City on this fact decision day with some key and Lisa Abramowicz some Jonathan Ferro features are positive. . Two tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq basically unchanged. . Now yields come down about 2 basis points 354 36 got a stronger much much stronger in G10 euro dollar negative five or six tenths of one per percent just about holding on to 99 not some euro dollar. . Ninety nine sixteen euro weakness this morning off the back of some strong words from the Russian leader. . Yeah your weakness. . Really critical. . Lisa pick this up. . I missed it to be blunt. . Point 9 9 1 6. . Anything under point nine nines a huge deal and we are there. . We’ll continue to monitor that again. . The vic’s 27 showing 24 to 27 in the last number of days. . Tension. . We will continue now on Russia and on their leader. . Annmarie Horden joins us here as we just simply rip up the script. . And I do so. . Anne-Marie in February announcing my Book of the year which was Angela Stent Putin’s World. . With all that’s going on here how would you judge how what I’m gonna to call the hard right of Russia or the center of Russia or what I’d call the liberal left of Russia. . How do they adapt to the comments of the last 24 hours. . I mean they get in line. . What happens when you don’t. . Yes Russia does have domestic politics. . You see that. . Whether it’s the Communist Party in the Duma which John and Lisa and I spoke about yesterday they’re the ones that came up in February and said we should recognize as separate entities Luhansk and Donetsk. . And then Putin went in announces a special military operation. . It was also the head of the Communist Party that said we should now be calling this a war. . After that counteroffensive that may have led Putin to want to actually make these moves because now he could put reservists on the ground in these territories if he sells to the Russian people that the these are legal Russian territory as the reservists. . I mean maybe it’s an unfair question to you but in your reporting well they also have contractors. . I know what a reservist is in Tulsa Oklahoma. . What’s a reservist in the euro mountains. . It’s individuals that joined the Russian military that are not being used right now. . You have to remember that Russia is also using a lot of contractors in this war and they’re not going for a full fledged conscription but they are calling up 300000 mature. . Count them as reserves. . This is putting the backs up of Russian everyday Russian individuals domestically. . This is going to be a bit more challenging for Putin. . Emery is there any coincidence or any overlap with the fact that Xi Jinping just met with Vladimir Putin and now this move of possibly calling up some of its reservists. . It’s the first thing email I woke up to this morning from a viewer who said Putin making this move after he just met with Xi Jinping. . And remember it was earlier this year that these two leaders said that their friendship has quote unquote no limits. . What do we have also this morning. . You have a seminar a military seminar. . Xi Jinping is telling that seminar to focus on preparing for war. . You also have Kyodo newspaper saying that at the party Congress next month which is this is an incredibly critical for a Xi Jinping that he is going to talk about his plan for reunification with Taiwan. . Now potentially these two items were discussed amongst each other because Putin doesn’t have a lot of friends right now. . He has Beijing. . He’s getting some ammunition from North Korea and the Iranians. . That’s really yet when it comes to pure potential friends at this moment. . What’s the U.S. . doing in response to Xi Jinping I mean this is coming at a pretty fraught moment on multiple levels. . Well Jake Sullivan the president’s national security adviser yesterday said that the U.S. . has one. . China policy has not changed. . But we heard for the fourth time from the president yet again to go a little bit more off script when it comes to Taiwan. . And that 60 Minutes interview really astonishing what he said not so much that they would just send warplanes and military. . He was asked unlike Ukraine would you send U.S. . personnel military men and women. . And he answered yes. . It couldn’t be more direct. . Amari thank you AMH. . Here in New York City for the U.N. . General Assembly Tom Reuters reporting that this morning I heard you squeeze in UNGA Reuters reporting early this morning. . You thought that was going to slide. . Come on. . I am. . How did you get to the box before we get completely derailed. . Just report from Reuters this morning that one way flights Tom san and gout after this announcement. . One way flights from Russia. . So direct flights from Moscow to Istanbul in Turkey to Armenia as well destinations where Russians can enter without a visa. . They’re sending out some of the back of this. . It’s very fluid and our news flow. . And that’s why I’m looking at more and more of the European journalists coverage that we’re seeing from Bloomberg and from other sources as well. . Jonas. . I’ll be honest John I just think it’s simply off the American radar slammed in this morning obviously but it bears almost careful scrutiny. . Absolutely. . Is that an escalation. . Lisa. . I think part of the markets e treating it as such as such an escalation. . The euro weaker off the back of some of this. . We saw the haven flow in the early part of the European session. . Is Vladimir Putin doubling down. . Right now it’s raising questions about what else he could do. . It does also though raise this issue. . And Anne-Marie is touched on this very well which is popular support of this. . Right. . It’s different when you have to actually go to war versus sit there and sort of hear the propaganda in terms of what the war is accomplishing. . I wonder how much the popularity or some of the issues they’re in are affecting some of the job owning both when it comes to Russia as well as China. . Just based on the fact they’re heading into a people’s Congress meeting that is coming at a pretty fraught time. . Also politically and from a social perspective due to the lockdowns readjusting our growth expectations lower. . I saw your note from Deutsche Bank earlier this morning. . Now we’re getting real about what a recession in the eurozone at least is going to look like. . Yeah it was pretty depressing. . I got to be honest. . And the bar is pretty high for me to get depressed but it really was depressing to see them downgrade their forecast for growth from negative zero point three percent negative two point two percent and saying that there is potential for further downside because of the potential for a really cold winter. . How much does this really get affected one way or another if there is an escalation does that really affect the gas supplies. . Because a lot of people are just discounting them altogether. . Can we just compare and contrast that with the ECB own forecasts for 2023. . What’s the growth there at positive zero point nine per cent for 2023. . And Tom you’ve got Deutsche Bank saying it’s going to be negative 2. . Yeah 2 and precedent. . The guard was asked a lot about this in a news conference. . Where’s the recession in the forecast. . You said it wasn’t in the base case. . Should it be in the base case. . Because Italian or most people for most people right now it is the base case for Europe. . We’re moving in real time. . And as we talk about these trends things like neutrality and know John the lift up in German yields is a different quality of lift up than America because of their more tepid nominal GDP and their lack of technology as an economy piece and leaving behind the negative interest rate era and moving on some with much much higher yields in Europe and beyond features positive two tenths on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq 100 basically unchanged on this Fed decision day yields lower by 2 basis points. . Your 10 year 353 ninety seven. . Is this a buy for Mike Collins and a team at PJM. . We’ll ask him next. . Life in New York City this morning. . Good morning on this decision day. . Here is your equity market just about positive by a little more than a tenth of 1 percent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq negative zero point zero three percent. . You know the numbers. . I’ll talk about them again if the last 10 Fed decisions on eight of them. . This market has rallied. . Can this market rally if Chairman Pound brings out the Jackson Hole speech once more and just read it verbatim once again we’ve got word today as bond markets done a ton of work already. . Twelve months ago we were at twenty one basis points on a two year. . Right now three point ninety six per cent yields come in by about a half a basis point on a 10 year down 2 basis points to 354 36. . A big change though over the last two months. . Your tie your tie yields so much higher in the U.S. . and elsewhere. . Let’s pick out a place where yields are not so much higher this year. . Let’s look at Japan. . Look at what’s happened with the bond market and look about happened with the currency. . Or rather I should rephrase that. . Look at what hasn’t happened with the bond market and look at what has happened with the currency you know to Betty climb this year relative to what we’ve seen elsewhere. . They’ve kept them pinned lower caps trying to sit on them. . A tenure in Japan at about 25 26 basis points and look at what’s happening with the currency. . Because of that some we’ve had a 25 percent move on dollar yet. . That’s a monster movie. . Let’s stay on that for Bloomberg Radio folks 144 17 is a huge deal on year and it’s finally giving way to a weaker yen just in the last 10 minutes ago. . So John and you know you look where the level is 145 146 a dialogue changes Tom. . Even the central banks that have moved they’re still struggling. . Look at Sterling 113. . Look at the Swedish currency. . Even with the wrecks bank delivering a 100 basis point hike against the dollar right now Tom is a tough tough go to get some kind of traction in the effects market even if you are hiking if you’re doing what the Bank of Japan is not doing. . Sterling intraday low. . John 113 5 11 12 is essentially unimaginable except for there right now. . Jack can I mentioned in our travels of the last three days for all of us we have finally broken through on the index that matters the Bloomberg total return United States aggregate index something in all the bonds. . Lisa knows this better than me. . Guess what you do low price in the index through the June low. . A difficult moment I think late tonight both looking forward to the conversation with Mike Collins and page him to see if this difficult moment is a big buying opportunity. . That’s across asset price action. . Want to get to a single name with you. . We can do that now with Lisa. . Hey Lisa. . Hey John. . So you know Tom’s been talking a lot about companies adapting and adjusting and how they do really deal with the situation that they’re dealt with. . And there are three stories today that really highlight to me how they are doing this. . And that is cutting jobs and cutting jobs at a corporate level. . Take a look at Gap. . Their shares are dramatically underperforming. . The broader market down 48 percent so far year to date. . Just announced that it’s cutting 500 corporate jobs in San Francisco New York in Asia. . This comes after their partnership with the former Canyon West fell apart. . It comes as a Ford downgraded some of their forecasts in August. . How much does this really tell a story for retail. . How much is this idiosyncratic. . Then take a look at Boeing. . This is a manufacturer of big planes. . They just said they’re going to outsource some of their finance and accounting jobs to India. . Their shares are lower by almost by more than 27 percent so far year to date. . It shows how people are trying to reduce costs in different creative ways perhaps cutting jobs perhaps outsourcing. . Not exactly the jobs that they used to outsource. . They still are hiring some engineers locally. . Just sort of shows the shifting winds and encompass the housing market. . A company that really depends on online sales has been absolutely decimated this year. . Those shares down more than 70 percent so far year to date. . The CEO coming out and saying that it was going to be cutting more jobs particularly in the technology sphere and that there’s more to come. . There’s some losses associated with this. . Again Tom you’ve been talking about adopting and adapting and adjusting. . That’s going to lead to the pain that we’re hearing from Fed Chair Jay Powell. . But where’s the 30 year mortgage here in like a week or two of six point two percent goes out Lisa to the gap. . And I think this is really important is one of the ideas here that’s new with a risk free rate is we finally these zombie d zombie fi zombie companies do they finally go out of existence after a 12 13 year gift which it’s full circle. . Back to your point about corporate credit. . Have we fully accounted for some of that pain in that market considering the fact that there has been the repricing that you pointed to but potentially there could be more to come. . Very good. . We will continue right now on this on corporate credit with Michael Collins senior portfolio manager of PJM Fixed Income. . Michael what I notice here and I understand the messiness of it let’s forget that yield up. . We all know that Chairman Powell deal that today but in many cases praise very. . Very very down. . And we’re seeing in the Bloomberg total return aggregate index the old Lehman Barclays indices as well. . What is the significance of new low price. . Are those aggregate indices. . Yeah Tom is as you point out has really been nowhere to hide this year in fixed income I mean and in our shop we’ve got three big things right. . We’ve kind of stepped aside on a duration meaning taking our our long positions down to neutral. . We’ve taken credit risk way down. . We’ve generally been a little long the dollar but that has not been enough to protect investors from that big trend down in prices. . The good news is as you know when bond prices are down below par with which they all are really for the first time I can think of in my career Tom we’re seeing the bonds across the board across all of our portfolios trading at big discounts to par. . And as you know as long as they don’t default. . As Lisa pointed out they end up back at par. . Right. . So. . So you actually had this really positive long time opportunity in fixed income which we haven’t had for for well over a decade. . Michael I look at the mantra of the real yield the whole professional study of the inflation adjusted yield. . Explain to mere mortals why the real yield matters. . Yeah I mean that is the world’s discount rate right. . I mean I’m always surprised when when people say wow I can’t believe stocks and bonds are both selling off at the same time this year. . And I tell them as well you just wait until you see real estate and private debt and other assets that that haven’t sold off because they’re not actively traded. . They’re not mark to market every day. . Wait for those shoes to drop because when the discount rate the world’s discount rate which is really real treasury yields by and large goes up as much as it has as much as you know a couple hundred basis points. . All asset prices have to come down. . And the question really is have they come down enough at this point. . Well let’s get into that right now Mike. . We caught up with our good friend Bob Michael Barr of J.P. . Morgan Asset Management yesterday. . I asked him about high yield. . He said not yet. . Patience spreads need to get somewhere close to 750 basis points. . That Treasuries need to get somewhere close to 4.5. . The Fed funds could push 5 percent. . Any of that resonate with you right now Mike. . Would you take the other side of that trade. . Yeah you know I’ll take a little bit of the other side on the rate thing. . I think we’re much closer on the rate side. . Right. . Our view is that the rates are going to crest and come down first and then credit spreads and equities will will continue to widen and sell off before they settle down. . But I think we’re really getting close to a point Jonathan where the likelihood of the Fed and most other central banks overshooting significantly on the upside and having to reverse course. . I know the whole concept of the pivot you know was in vogue a couple of months ago. . And now people are pushing that aside. . And wow as they keep pushing these rates up at the same time that global growth you know risk is coming down. . Earnings are coming down. . As Lisa points out the faults are probably going to go off. . Geopolitical risk continues to to elevate. . Wow. . And inflation globally is really kind of rolling over. . And I think it’s going to be probably a lot lower in a year from now. . Just as all of those things are happening these central banks are jacking up rates ad nauseum. . And I think that’s a real recipe for a big reverse course on the rate side on the credit side. . I think you’re right. . I mean earnings we’ve done a lot of work on earnings expectations going forward. . And I think they’re going to keep coming down. . Right. . And people don’t talk enough about the dollar and the impact on that for U.S. . companies for their competitiveness further repaid Patriot earnings. . The labor costs continue to put pressure on margins. . And as Lisa pointed out you know you’re starting to see layoffs finally happen. . So I think there’s a little more downside in credit before. . Before you jump in with both feet. . This is all really mess here. . Michael I wonder just to put it all together quickly if you could give us a sense of how you play this the conviction behind buying certain discounted bonds taking the other side above Michael but also acknowledging what you see coming. . Yeah I mean you stick with you stick with higher quality credit right and presumably that’s what a big active shop with 140 panelists. . Liza Right. . And that’s really our bread and butter. . And this is an opportunity in the market where where everything is kind of sold off right in unison just to some extent. . And there are real lot of relative value opportunities. . You can buy really high quality credits at really big yields really big spreads low dollar prices. . So there is a lot of opportunity there without taking a lot of credit risk. . And we’ve taken our credit is down. . But the yields that we’re seeing across the board in the bonds we own the high quality bonds we own the portfolios we manage are really big. . So I mean you don’t have to take a lot of credit risk. . Ultimately you’ll want to do that dip down and credit it but it’s definitely too early. . Just so I think like for the rest of the day and get it right. . If you’ve been down this 10 year 350 Mike. . Yeah we we we haven’t yet. . We’re we’re we’re dead neutral here. . Jonathan then. . But but again that is going to be the the big the first trade really out of the gates here. . And maybe you have to wait for for today. . The Fed is going to probably sound pretty hawkish today even though they’ve done a good job on Fed days. . I know we’ve talked about this on the program before. . Typically the days the Fed meets in the days Jerome Powell speaks that the equity markets tend to go up. . So they do a good job of getting investors off the ledge a little bit. . But but you know those that dot plot is going to be ugly. . I think a lot of it’s probably priced in and the markets are braced for it. . But there will be an opportunity I would bet the next couple of quarters to really start getting long duration. . We’ll catch up and talk about it. . My comments that a feature. . Thank you Mike. . Now’s not the time Tom. . But he did give you a sequence of events a sequence of what he would buy and when and why he’d find them before others have trouble with the sequence. . I thought it was really intelligent from Mike Collins. . But what was the sequence of events twelve months ago. . Things like Treasury’s first because it’s gonna get hammered. . This Fed will have to back away but a more straightforward folio. . Sent us out with a note to a 60 40 tonne this year. . Not nice teachers. . It’s a triple average cash a quarter of 4 percent. . If I take cave outperformed everyone this year. . Congrats. . The Chancellor called me back. . Can you run a portfolio at the Treasury. . Somebody suffers all cash. . Sterling. . Oh yes. . No. . Well that’s a really important point. . You had you know from New York this is pulling back. . Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . Vladimir Putin is threatening to escalate the war in Ukraine even further. . Putin is calling up three hundred thousand reserve troops and vowed to use all means necessary to defend Russian territory. . He also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons. . Meanwhile the Kremlin is moving swiftly to annex parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. . The feds ready today to hike again and to send a hawkish message for the third policy meeting in a row. . Policymakers are expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points. . That would bring rates to the highest level since 2008. . Chair Jerome Powell is likely to hammer home that he believes further rate hikes are needed to tame inflation. . European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says borrowing costs will rise more in the months ahead. . Speaking in Frankfurt Lagarde said the ECB has taken major steps to tackle inflation and she expects to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings. . China says it has the patience to bring someday bring Taiwan under its control. . Now a government official said that what he calls Taiwan compatriots realize the future is in unification. . That contrasts with polling in Taiwan showing skeptical views for Beijing. . Beyond Meat has suspended Chief Operating Officer Doug Ramsey. . He was arrested on charges that he beat a man’s nose during a fight after a college football game in Arkansas. . It’s another blow for the plant based protein company which cut its revenue forecast last month. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . This is Bloomberg. . I thought that I would never get to 4 percent but I’ve changed that view. . They certainly will. . And probably by the end of this year I think they’re going to have to go higher at the beginning of next year. . But then I think they’ll pause. . I also think they’ll slow down their rate hikes the further they get away from the neutral rate. . I was making Green the global chief economist of the Con Institute. . Many people share that view. . That’s the change for the consensus view in the last three months or so. . Most people now looking for that forehand on this market price for something close to 4.5. . The Fed decides in several days time life from NATO. . OK this is Bloomberg Surveillance equities up by a third of 1 per cent on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq 100 up by a little more than a tenth of 1 percent yield to labor by 3 basis points on a 10 year 350 358 good effect decision statement of course a news conference with Chairman Powell and some forecasts and a dot plot in the mix as well. . We do. . It’s going to be absolutely fascinating because we’re thrilled. . The former vice chairman Richard Clarke will join us here in a number of hours as well. . Vincent Reinhart he’s chief economist at Dreyfus in Melbourne. . But on this historic day for Central Bank Mr Clare Dr Clare would suggest that Mr Reinhart is a must listen. . Vincent Reinhart invented modern research in Washington at the Fed for Alan Greenspan and has a terrific perspective on forecasts. . Maybe not dot plots. . We won’t blame him for that. . Vince thank you so much for joining today. . I went back and I did a Google search of the Fed blinks and there’s any number of days where this is part of the Zeit Geist. . When does the central bank blink. . When do they stop a theory to go the other way. . When the policy choice gets harder right now. . Here’s the bad news. . This is the easy part of central banking because they are so far away from their inflation goal. . Jay Powell wakes up in the morning and says inflation is too high. . He worries as he goes to bed at night. . C inflation is still too high. . Policy choices raise rates. . It will get harder when you have to top out where you raise rates right. . Inflation is closer to goal and the unemployment rate is rising. . This the end date managers I said of a certain vintage Vince that we’re sort of used to higher interest rates like an actual risk free rate. . We’ve all been there before. . Does the media and the Zeit Geist of Wall Street do they overplay the world’s coming to an end. . Given a march to neutrality just about every time don’t they. . The fact is that there are long cycles in rates. . We’ve been here before. . The Fed goes through tightening any tight tightening spells and easing spells and. . Pauses and we’re just tightening spell. . It is going to have to last longer. . That’s a consequence of being slow out of the starting gate. . You’ll have to go higher. . That’s a consequence of being slow at the starting gate. . But this time next year we’ll be talking about what how long will the Fed be pausing. . And so we were just speaking with Peter Hooper of Deutsche Bank who sees neighbor who or the neutral that the end rate for Fed funds rates to be at near 5 percent possibly exceeding that. . We’re hearing more people call for a greater likelihood of that kind of pain that kind of rate backdrop for a prolonged period of time. . Do you agree. . Yes I think Terry Powell agrees with Peter as well. . Remember at the last press conference chair Powell pointed to the estimates for natural rate and said that his committee’s his own view was higher. . Well generally when the chair is saying his own view is higher it tells you the committee is going up. . So I would expect that the summary of economic projections will see a higher natural rate. . And importantly they have to go above their natural rate in order to create some slack that slows inflation. . So the base is rising and the overage relative to that base is falling higher given they started late. . Vincent what do you expect the unemployment rate to be in those projections. . How much of a downside how much more of a potential recession case do you see starting to leak out in some of this forward look from the Fed today. . Well the part to worry about is central banks were always incremental. . They always don’t weigh out all the bad news. . So I would expect the unemployment rate to go up. . I would expect less of an immaculate decline. . Inflation as has been the case more than a simple summary of economic projections but I still think there’ll be more akin to reality. . It’ll be worse than what they say. . So rather than an unemployment rate at or above the natural rate as it is within the last couple of months I would expect to see the unemployment rate go forward ahead in their forecast. . I would expect the unemployment very to be at the point next year. . Wow. . Vince you’re on the same side as Deutsche Bank then Vincent Reinhart of Dreyfus and Mellon potentially four five percent unemployment to Eddie to say that today. . Do you think Lisa in the projections because right now that something close to full on unemployment does it really matter. . I mean I think from it from a strategic point of view people are going to be looking to see whether they pull a Bank of England and they give a dose of honesty. . But does it really matter if they reflect that in their forward projections if there is a general sense that they bring growth lower and they bring the inflation rate higher they bring their rates higher then you’re basically you can extrapolate what you want it from that. . We’ll catch up with Diane Swonk a little bit later from KPMG. . And thank Diane said the last few summary of economic projections. . We’ve had the last few set of forecasts. . We’ve had Tom from this fund of research. . She’s called them aspirational fanciful I think was the phrase gone. . It used as well. . Maybe we’ve migrated from fanciful here in the last X number of weeks John. . Four week moving average on jobless claims that come out weekly. . You take a four week moving average you know the math two hundred twenty four thousand. . That is so far not from a five percent unemployment rate. . I just find the whole conference Tom. . That’s the point. . Deutsche Bank is making. . This is what Magnus said. . Peter trying to say that to get inflation lower bites into this economy you need rates much higher. . That’s that. . That’s that. . That’s the position. . Okay. . We witnessed it. . I mean every airline’s packed. . I don’t know if the airlines are going to make money. . We’ve got certain Uber bulls like Jim Glassman of J.P. . Morgan saying look here’s where the consumer is right now. . They’ve got a tough task. . If the theory is we’re hearing on the show are to play out and then we’ve got Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley Tom he’s just been right. . Right right. . For the whole of 2012. . Right. . Right. . To be bearish on this equity market the equity market is where it is with the VIX at twenty six point nine seven John. . And you know the classic rule is there’s no thanks till 30 and you may get on Mike Wilson 30 on VIX. . The damage is in the bond market. . John the institutional mass Lisa knows this better than me. . The institutional mass that is losing money daily in the bond market is unmeasurable. . I’ve never seen in my lifetime it’s piling up in a big way at least with FedEx came out last week. . I think we both thought the same thing. . We both thought of Mike and the colleagues making on antics that we’ve had the right shock and now we’re going to see the consequences of it. . And what is the read through to job cuts. . And I say that as we look for a path to get to that greater area a few less slack in the labor market. . We talk about a four and a half to five percent unemployment rate and you start to wonder how quickly. . Are these forecasts getting downgrades and our gap is Boeing is a you know some of these companies that are coming out compass are those outliers. . Or is that going to be much more common. . What would make my Wilson constructive on this equity market again. . You can ask. . The man from Morgan Stanley joins us next. . Looking forward to our futures. . Up four tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P on this Fed decision day with Tom Keene Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro futures a positive. . From New York Adam Radio seen on TV. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance. . What’s been really the engine here has been the strength of the labor market. . The strength of the consumer. . Then June 17 below is not that far away from here. . It’s not a heroic call to say that anymore. . We’re also not convinced that the data is going to be bad enough that it’s going to take us down through new lows for the back end of the Fed. . We’ll have to shift and or we’re just going to go into a deeper recession than we may already be in. . The Fed funds rate will overcome the rate of inflation. . That’s when the Fed has done enough. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . Good morning everyone. . Jonathan Ferro. . Lisa Abramowicz. . Tom Keene. . On Thursday. . So much to talk about. . Richard. . Clara will join us the former vice chairman of the Fed to lead our Fed coverage today. . John I want to switch from the Fed to the stock market with Mike Wilson coming up. . There is a toxic brew out there. . There’s blood on the street and Mike’s got it right. . Oh yeah. . He’s dead. . Right. . Dead on. . Basically look for the right shock and now look for the earnings concern. . And are we starting to see that with companies like FedEx like Ford in the last week off the Gulfstream. . What I notice is the Bloomberg total return bond index. . John it is through to new lows breaching the June lows that we’ve seen the 60 40 Bloomberg index down 17 percent from the peak. . There’s nowhere to hide. . Bob Michael Barr J.P. . Morgan. . Tom says it’s going to get worse. . He’s looking for Fed funds maybe to get close to 5 percent for treasuries at 4.5 and for high yield spreads to go somewhere close to 750. . His message is not to buy yet to wait to be patient to wait for a recession that he thinks is coming soon. . She was expert at unknown. . I said who is that woman in print. . Lisa Abramowitz expert on the spread market. . Lisa the spread market always says so much. . What’s it say this morning as we go to Mike Wilson saying there’s a little more fear it’s just be getting around the edges but not getting carried away. . And there is a question of what exactly it’s pricing in because it’s still far below some of the heights are the other times when we’ve seen not only rate hiking but also credit fears. . When does this problem this goes directly to Mike Wilson. . When does the issue with rates bleed over to an economic pain story. . We’ve seen that play out in certain equities. . Have we seen it fully play out in credit. . You know J.P. . Morgan at least J.P. . Morgan Asset Management. . But Michael that aside like how he doesn’t think that we’ve seen enough not the equity research and investment banks that you reply. . I mean. . Well I mean out of that zero hedge message me a moment ago and asked if Bob. . Bob Michael Barr spoken to Macca recently. . Let’s read between the lines. . I’m not here. . Okay. . In the guys are running here. . I’m going to get the daily check going if we need to get to Mike Wilson for Global Wall Street. . Unreal. . On television. . And John Effect speaks volumes. . It is the litmus paper of the system. . Yen up through 144 fractionally. . Euro visited new weakness in sterling. . We couldn’t support a john on our trip there. . I try. . You tried 30 40 fucking a snapshot of foreign exchange right now on a stronger against everything. . With the exception of the Swiss franc a sad defensive thinks out euro dollar negative six tenths of one percent and just about holding on to ninety nine on euro dollar ninety nine. . 0 8 yields down 3 basis points. . They’ve been so much higher recently over the last few weeks in fact for the 10 year the last two months 352 seventy on a 10. . Yet some futures just a bit firmer up a third of 1 percent on the S&amp;P. . It is so true that the media the financial media loves to look at strategists who say are you’re right or wrong you’ve failed you’re done. . The reality is the way strategists are used on Wall Street and no one has given more guidance this year in the last 12 months. . And Michael Wilson CIO and chief U.S. . equity strategist at Morgan Stanley because it’s been a consistent and cogent message of beware the future. . Mike we are now where we have a Mike Wilson stock market. . And what I note is you mention it is picked over. . I can’t find scale. . There’s not enough to choose from. . Where do I hide. . Yeah. . Well thanks Tom appreciate your kind words. . I mean look I think the I mean the market is picked over because this is where we are in the evolution of this bear market. . Essentially when bear markets began they always go after the High Flyers you know things that are kind of ridiculously priced or where their earnings risk is as more evident. . And that’s what happened really kind of earlier this year late last year quite frankly really began almost a year ago and out. . But as you kind of go through people didn’t. . Hi it’s like the water rises. . You go to the higher part of the mountain. . And so it really is kind of crammed into the same stuff just kind of waiting for some conclusion to the story. . Either we avoid a recession and move forward of a soft landing or we down and we clear the decks and then we can move forward from there. . We’re kind of more in the second camp because our view on earnings is just so negative. . Whether we have a recession or not all of our top down models which are pretty good are telling us that you know the spread between our forecast and the actual forecast by the street would mean bottoms up is has never been wider. . It’s only time it’s been as wide as you know in 0 8 and then back in 0 1. . And we know what happened there. . So the earnings story is what we’re focused on. . I mean the Fed is important still. . Obviously they’re not getting off the gas here on their hawkishness and nor should they. . But that’s pretty priced to me. . I wouldn’t be surprised if today we get some relief quite frankly led by the bond market after the Fed does their thing. . Maybe stocks can rally one more time but the end game for us is all about the earnings and the growth now. . And we’re you know we’re just not optimistic there for the next six to 12 months. . And net value price pretty quickly see growth steady 400 is the base case 50 percent probability. . Mike 3000 the back case recession scenario 40 percent probability. . I put out this research that quote on Twitter in the last week and a lot of people wanted to know why the other 10 percent. . Mike IBEX the 10 percent. . Yeah that’s that’s the mystery. . Now I mean it’s pretty straightforward. . I mean the Bolt case is just not that probable. . I think you know November and we talked about this as you recall gentlemen the Bolt case was Goldilocks. . And we said well you know the probability of Goldilocks looks pretty unlikely. . So we bought case. . You know we can flex that from you know zero or not really. . 05 that 20 percent were you know sort of 5 to 10 percent now. . But the bull case is not in the latter. . Goldilocks it’s kind of a soft landing for the economy. . However that’s not a soft landing for earnings. . So you know our bolt case is not much different from our from our base case. . I mean we think we think maybe you don’t make new lows in the Bolt case but there’s an upside. . Okay. . Over the next six months. . And that’s really how we manage money. . I mean we we look at risk reward and you know at thirty nine hundred and the risk reward is probably five to one. . You know on the downside is sort of the sort of the middle of our of our viewpoint and that’s at the S&amp;P level. . Let me just clear because Tom asked a question which is you know this is the part of the bear market. . We should be looking for individual stocks that you want to own coming out of this. . Some are priced appropriately where you want to take that risk. . But look what happened this week with Fed Ex. . I mean clearly that wasn’t priced. . So you gotta be really careful thinking oh well everyone knows this. . It’s already priced and you get hit over the head and the stock’s down 20 percent. . So that’s you know everybody has their own risk tolerance. . They have their own work. . And you know we have our own focused list as well. . We’re staying defensively oriented. . We’re not reaching for cyclicality or you know kind of crazy growth stocks yet. . We think it’s premature for that. . But we’re getting closer. . I mean we think we’re within a couple of months probably. . So there’s an issue with how long this is going to last. . We were speaking yesterday with Chris Brown. . You talked of a lost decade of profits on the headline level for the S&amp;P. . Just based on the fact that yields are going remain higher inflation is going to be greater. . Do you agree or do you think they’re going to get a rebound on the other side of this six months 12 months down the line. . Yeah I mean I think we will get a rebound but we are view for a while now has been we’ve moved out of the monetary policy dominated world to a fiscal dominant policy world. . And what that means is that the Fed is no longer in other central banks quite frankly can no longer smooth over the edges the way they have historically because inflation while maybe it’s going to come down in the next six months which is our core view it’s not going away it’s going to be dormant and then we’ll re accelerate again in the next upturn. . What’s going to happen. . Lisa I think is that you’re going to clear the decks and up on expectations on growth that you can then have a week celebration and that will be driven by the natural ebbing and flowing of supply and demand but also more aggressive fiscal policy. . I think it’s interesting to note in the last month I mean fiscal policy has been turned down like a spigot again. . Right. . We have this debt forgiveness program here. . We have the 200 billion pound stimulus for energy subsidies in the UK which is equivalent to a trillion dollars in a U.S. . economic standpoint. . So it’s kind of interesting when you have kind of raised worry about inflation but the fiscal policy is working counter productively to the monetary tightening. . But that’s the way I think we’re living in now. . And you have to understand that because it’s not all bearish. . It will be a time when fiscal picks it up again next year even though monetary can’t do its job as has been doing in the past. . And in the Fed’s job in my view and the ECB is you. . It’s abuse job in my view. . Their main job going forward is to be funding the government whatever the government decides to spend. . They will have to fund implicitly very similar to the 40s analog that we’ve been using. . Mike just one final question and I think it’s lost in the conversations I often see with you that it’s not just about an index level code with even the team. . There is some single name stuff in the mix too. . Could you help us with just a call right now something you do like in this equity markets something that has worked these sticking with. . Yeah. . I mean I think like the managed care stocks have been terrific. . Mean that’s an area that you know these are either gross DAX and they don’t they know they’re not priced as gross DAX. . They never happen because of concerns about perhaps regulatory oversight and things like that. . But you know health care in general I would argue is an area of the market where you have pent up demand from the pandemic as opposed to payback in demand like for technology spending or consumer goods and for whatever reason is still trades really cheaply. . And once again it goes back to this idea that there may be fear about real pricing controls and things like that. . But that’s to me that’s a fair pitch. . And you know that that’s an area we’ve had a lot of exposure be it on pharma managed care some of the cheaper areas of private health care. . And I think that continues to work. . Other area would be say integrated energy companies where they’re more defensively oriented not so dependent on the price deck. . They pay great dividend and you get some commodity exposure you know as a hedge against your inflation staying sticky or high. . But the overriding message John as you know this year if must have been defensive earnings stability operational efficiency boring type metrics. . But you know it’s been working nicely and I think it will continue until we get the trough in this bear market. . It’s been working in a tough tough year. . Congrats to you. . And that same Mike Wilson so far for 2022. . Just absolutely brilliant. . Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley T.K. . a man whose code along with his team really ready well for the year so far. . Yeah. . What’s important is how they dovetail. . And I really can’t say enough about the fractious nature of Morgan Stanley research. . I love John how they’re argumentative and visibly argumentative. . You saw that was Zentner moving from transitory to a more difficult inflation along with pretty much everyone has some sound from that. . Futures future’s up four tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P. . It is Fed decision day for our audience worldwide. . Heard on radio seen on TV. . This is Glenn Beck. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Mateo. . Vladimir Putin declares it a fight to the death with the U.S. . and its allies. . He’s calling up three hundred thousand reserve troops in a major escalation of the war in Ukraine who also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons. . He said that the U.S. . and its allies want to destroy Russia. . A Ukrainian counter offensive in the last few weeks has dealt Russian troops their worst defeats since the early months of the conflict. . The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates today to the highest level since 2008. . And it’s likely to forecast that there will be further increases for the third straight meeting. . Policymakers are expected to raise rates by 75 basis points. . Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to stress the Fed’s resolve to curb inflation. . That’s near a 40 year high. . The Bank of Japan is trying to cap upward pressure on yields before a policy decision later this week. . The central bank announced an unscheduled bond buying operation DOJ. . Governor hurry go. . Kuroda has emphasized his determination to maintain rock bottom interest rates even though many other developed nations are increasing them. . And Amazon’s cargo airline is growing at the slowest pace since the start of the pandemic. . Researchers with the DePaul University’s Chaddock Institute of Metropolitan Development say the number of flights on the company’s air freighters rose just three point eight percent between March and September. . The e-commerce giant has already closed or delays plans for dozens of warehouses. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Mateo. . This is Bloomberg. . I think it’s unsustainable to have the Fed hiking rates at a very rapid rate doing Kuti with you know the economy slowing at some stage of the game. . The Fed will have to shift and or you know we’re just going to go into a deeper recession than we may already be. . Kathy Jones that of Charles Schwab governments that Fed decision that a bit later this afternoon futures hang up. . I said if 1 percent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq up a tenth of 1 percent. . Max Kanter of HSBC just published in Hetchy. . When touts I lose we retain our maximum underweight in equities. . If growth continues to hold up central banks will have to do more to slam the brakes putting pressure on valuations. . And he goes on to say. . But if activity disappoints quickly falling growth and earnings expectations will also be bad for risk assets. . Tellme tails. . I lose heads. . You win. . Can we stayed in London over that long duration of wonderful stay there amid the sadness for England. . Max Kuttner was our gloomiest guest. . I think it was. . He was also a bit of a highlight at the same time. . Thomas tried to catch up with him like Mike Wilson clip me but right through to 2020. . Anyone tried to get me brought the walk round my slipped. . Right. . It takes a while my Mikey. . Thank you Carrie. . Have you. . Thanks. . Let’s just go around the room. . Maybe not. . It’s true. . And also her grand banks 40 42 as if that’s what it says John. . Gloomy but right. . Is that what he says. . Bumper sticker over boat right now. . Michael McKee with us here as we go forward into the Fed meeting. . And again Richard Claire is scheduled to be with us which is wonderful. . Mike I have such a respect for your ability to drill down into this minutia. . I just am unable to do it. . Which of the forecast. . Which of the dots. . What is the item you will look for first when they release that stuff this afternoon. . Well I think we’re going to be looking at the median dot which does come out in the S&amp;P as well as on the dot plot. . Because what people want to know on Wall Street is how fast are they going to get to terminal and what do they think. . Terminal is. . And then the third question is how long is it going to stay there. . So all three questions will be sort of answered in one line on the economic projections. . Then we’ll also look at unemployment because the Fed has got a forecast under its dot plot what it thinks unemployment will be. . And that sort of tells you what they think is acceptable in terms of unemployment. . If if it follows the book and unemployment goes up so far they haven’t had a whole lot of luck pushing that up to the top. . For those of you on radio you’re advantaged right now because we just showed the dot plot. . It looks like the landing effort at JFK and a blizzard Michael McKee. . Beyond that there will be the questions today. . It’s unfair to say what is a question you will ask. . What does he not want to say in the press conference today. . Oh he doesn’t want to say anything about a possible pivot one way or another whether he uses that word or another. . He doesn’t want to suggest that the Fed is in any way going to back off at least for a year maybe longer. . We’ll see in the dot plot how long they keep rates up. . You look at what Fed funds futures are pricing and they see the Fed starting to cut rates in May of 2023. . And that is exactly the feeling the Fed doesn’t want to encourage. . They want people who think the Fed is going to get rates up and keep them there until inflation goes down. . Mike does the Fed have a serious credibility problem. . I don’t think so. . It’s kind of funny the comment you were leading in with about heads I lose tails you win is kind of an admission that the Fed is going to do what it’s going to do. . And they’re looking at how that’s going to impact asset classes. . I think they do need to follow through. . If they were to back off at any sign of weakness in the economy then they would have a credibility problem. . But so far when you look at the inflation expectations they’re relatively anchored. . They’re actually coming down a little bit. . So I think people are have bought into the Fed’s program at this point. . One of the biggest unknowns right now is how long it’s going to take for this economy to truly feel higher rates. . And the reason why this is important is because some people argue that the Fed won’t know if they dramatically overshoot until it’s too late. . How much are people gaming out the length of time that duration it takes before we start to see the ramifications of a 4 percent Fed funds rate. . Well you’ve got sort of two camps out there one that thinks the Fed can maybe bring us in for a soft landing. . And if it doesn’t it’ll be a mild recession and it’ll come probably later next year. . And there are others who think they’ve already gone too far and we’re going to head into the teeth of recession fairly soon. . And you see that reflected in those Fed funds futures. . But the problem for the Fed is the data they watch to see where they are is backward looking and the effects of their policies is forward looking with the lags. . So they’ve got to try to extrapolate between the two. . And it isn’t easy. . And that is a question on my list for Jay J. . How are you going to know where you are and whether or not you’ve gone too far and CAC. . They have always said well we know how to deal with inflation. . So if if inflation went up too high we would know what to do. . We could pivot right away. . But what if the opposite is true. . The economy starts to really fall and the Fed doesn’t know that’s happening yet. . Mark McKay thank you. . Mike thank you very much. . And looking forward to the news conference with Mike McKenna’s conference later on the Fed. . SHUGG the Fed decides least we talked about that anyway. . Is the Fed being emboldened by a lagging indicator. . I mean basically that’s the issue at a time when you start to see the Fed ex ISE of the world come out and say things are moving so quickly they have to readjust their forecasts. . FedEx might be dealing with some specific issues that has to do with FedEx and FedEx alone. . But we’re also seeing it from other companies. . At what point does that become relevant for the Fed. . Is that data that they’re going to track. . And Annmarie Horden said he just published he said a hawkish surprise would be power suggesting upcoming hikes remain larger in size or that neutral policy rates have migrated higher. . A less likely deficit outcome would be pound emphasizing that policy rate increases were slower pause at some point some once again the news conference often about emphasis of the Fed chair and also the markets going to be watching. . And we’re going to correlate all that into 2 p.m. . here on equities bonds currencies commodities. . John moments ago Euro Swiss he made a dash to news with strength. . I would suggest if Russia fears Putin fears and that. . But we’re at a point where dollars on the cusp of breaking out we’re not there yet. . But can you imagine dollar strength into the press conference. . I can’t because we’ve seen it right now. . Let’s say right now one 77 111 potentially going into this VIX y same thing. . Yeah. . Euro dollar just clinging on to ninety nine sterling Lisa 113 levels that if we’d mentioned at the start of the year I would have laughed and pointed that out just yesterday in yesterday’s conversation. . That’s right. . What credit does Chris Brown was. . He said in the commercial break you said John I watched bank one of our interviews out of the shadows. . I don’t know. . Here we go. . I said 150 on telly and you laughed at me. . And guess what. . We’re not at 150. . Good jobs said he said you totally missed it. . We’re only at 144. . A terrible cold. . It’s going to keep everything that you’re going to stick to it. . He’s a great coach. . Let’s give it to Chris. . 143 98 on. . He and Michael Pond’s going to join us from Barclays. . Just a moment here. . A dollar just holding on to ninety nine negative seven tenths of one percent. . This is pulling back. . Live from New York City this morning. . Good morning to you. . Just about positive on the S&amp;P for half of 1 percent on the S&amp;P 500 futures up on the Nasdaq my third of 1 percent. . Oh so pushing higher yields pushing lower by 4 basis points on a 10 year 350 to 60 euro dollar just about holding on to 99 99 0 6. . That currency peg negative six tenths of one per cent. . Some real lift on a strength out there in the mix. . Shout out to post say on Twitter. . We can rename the program simple. . In fact the Brit the bad and the bow tie right away to start the day. . Thank you. . Thank you very much for that. . I think that works. . We should rename the podcast The Brit the band the bow tie. . You know we could do that. . I think the podcast that works as well as in IBEX beautifully digital product. . And in fact over the years you know the digital products becoming more and more important including podcasts. . We’re working on that every day with Scott Havens and we move forward on that. . Now that we’ve all returned. . Right now we return to what started the program years ago which is speak to people that actually spend 24/7 on something narrow and excellent. . David Rosenberg passing inflation maybe Steven Englander in his brilliant work on cross rates and effects. . One of those some years ago was Michael Pond. . His fancy title now as head of global inflation linked research at Barclays far more accurately. . He is truly expert. . With the exception maybe of Ian Lincoln at BMO on full faith and credit. . And he joins us today Michael Pond. . If I look at the real yield and I look at two partial differentials of the nominal yield and some measurement of inflation which matters right now it’s the real yield that matters. . And it’s moved up a lot over the summer. . The market was was not really buying into the Fed’s resolve to hike rates enough to slow the economy and getting inflation down. . Since Jackson Hole though really yields have have soared particularly at the front end where they were almost at at zero earlier this month. . Now they’re above 1 percent. . When we look at short and forward so the markets move a lot and really accepted the hawkish tone of the Fed. . So if I look not at the 10 year real yield but Michael parties go shorter to maybe the two year if you agree with me on that from a negative 300 basis points conversion to a positive 164 basis points that’s a hugely linear jump condition. . How do other asset classes react to the Michael Pond world. . Well risk assets do not love higher yields that are not supported by strong growth. . Really we’re where real yields are rising here is because the Fed has become much more hawkish trying to slow the economy. . And that’s in part why risk assets have been on the back foot since Jackson Hole. . So the Fed’s trying to get the economy in a position where inflation comes down and then it can take its foot off the off the brake a little bit and allow growth to go back up to where we think we’re years from that. . The Fed’s resolve is strong here. . That was clear at the at the Jackson Hole speech by by Chair Powell ripping up this go off the script then and channeling his inner Volcker risk assets have responded. . But now they’re at the point where perhaps they’ve overreacted. . You know obviously we’ll we’ll get the message from the Fed that’s on the hawkish side. . But markets are already prepared for a very hawkish Fed. . So it’s a delicate balance today. . Before we veer too far into that they might be prepared for a hawkish Fed. . There’s a question of how quickly that leads to economic integration and we can get there. . But I want to sit on this idea right now of what it means to have a Volcker ISE Federal Reserve particularly with real rates at the highest levels going back to 2011. . Do you foresee ever again in the next few decades this Federal Reserve going back to zero interest rates. . It’s very possible. . You know we thought that the market was pricing in too much of too high of a probability of strong Fed cuts. . And next year in late summer those that basically had been taken out as appropriate. . But we certainly if you look at the housing market and say the housing market becomes a sign of the broader economic outlook it then then we could be in trouble here and the Fed would have to respond putting its dull hat back on. . We think we’re not likely to enter that that regime but it’s certainly possible that we enter a recession. . They’ve had has to recover. . You know backtrack and send rates right back to zero. . Well OK. . So this is sort of the big attention right now in bond markets particularly on the long end with your tenure yields at the highest levels that they’ve been going back years and years. . And yet some people including Michael Collins from PJM Fixed Income earlier are saying it’s unclear whether it’s really time to pounce because there could be more. . Is this the last time. . We’ll see real yields of this level because this Fed is poised to make some sort of turn in the not too distant future. . I think it 100 percent depends on the path of core inflation readings and the labor market. . That’s why the Fed is reacting so hawkish. . Lee here they’ve done quite a bit. . Some parts of the economy is has begun to slow such as the housing market. . But the latest print on core CPI was point six. . And labor markets clearly remain quite quite quite quite robust at a three point seven percent unemployment rate. . The Fed really needs to see a slowdown in the monthly pace of inflation readings particularly on core and a weakening of the labor market again. . The chair talked about inducing pain in the economy again channeling his inner Volcker in order to get inflation down. . So the Fed has to do a lot more to get get the economy where it wants. . Michael you embrace a dual mandate and I get that. . You know we could talk all day about jobless claims. . This and the other thing are true mean Dallas. . Maybe the chairman will bring that up today. . He’s got another mandate which is the credibility that he said but just up against political realities. . If we get a Barclays recession if we get a Barclays sort of recession does that become a third mandate for this chairman. . Well the Fed is absolutely trying to make sure it retains credibility particularly with CAC when it comes to inflation fighting. . So one of the reasons why it’s being so hawkish here is to make sure that inflation expectations don’t get out of control because that’s when the Fed fears an inflationary spiral where inflation is high. . People expect it to be high and it just feeds on itself. . So one of the things the Fed is trying to do here is make sure that high inflation itself doesn’t lead to higher inflation expectations. . So it’s trying to maintain its credibility. . And if we look at break evens if we look at surveys such as that from the New York Fed or the University of Michigan the Fed is doing a good job on that front and it’s able to ignore any political issues with it with a slowdown. . John I’m sorry politics matters here. . It’s going to matter tomorrow for Bank of England. . It’s going to matter today for Chairman Paul. . So I don’t disagree. . And I think Michael this is going to be the difficult part. . How do they convince people that high unemployment is a price worth paying for lower inflation. . Easy to say that now but when people actually start to see materially higher unemployment how difficult do you think this is going to get. . Well that’s why the S&amp;P the survey of economic projections or the dots if you will all be so important today. . When we get the statement when we look at the statement one of things we’ll be looking at is the unemployment rate path. . So you know the ACP is supposed to be the economic outlook under a path of of perfect monetary policy. . And if the unemployment rate remains elevated in their forecasts that’s a signal to the market that they’re willing to tolerate decently higher unemployment rates in order to get inflation down. . That’s a message that the Fed has been sending. . But we’ll really be looking at the S&amp;P to confirm that. . Michael just real quick here I’m wondering what your projection is for how quickly inflation will come down that headline CPI at the end of this year at the end of next. . We’re fairly optimistic that it will start to slow particularly with the October reading in part because of technical reasons at least in CPI. . But even beyond that again we’ve seen signs in commodities and shipping rates in an ag related futures. . Corn wheat etc. . that many price pressures have peaked. . Wages though are keeping inflation high and that’s the key to inflation really rolling over. . Michael just quickly what are you talking about in terms of levels going to end the year at 6 percent at 4 percent. . What do we got. . We think we’ll we’ll certainly come down from that when it comes to headline inflation in part because of the strong decline in gasoline prices since since March. . But core can remain sticky. . So while we think will slow and inflation readings but certainly well above where the Fed would like them. . A punt if. . Please. . Thank you. . I have one. . Barclays went very quiet when this interview started. . I can tell you the commercial break. . It was this beautiful but yes. . Hum. . Coming off the trading floor. . ISE Barclays. . Tom wasn’t it fantastic as they put it thanks to Michael to see your manager in a memo today Bondeson was surveillance so they should just hide and seek. . It’s just beautiful. . Just like old mr. . Yeah. . And frankly for Q4 and into next year that’s a big debate John. . The Guardian in London and the acclaimed Ian Frazier one of the great authors and thinkers of economics in your United Kingdom. . I love what he resurrects from Ronald Reagan. . Trickle down economics. . John is that what you are observing. . Yeah. . You should probably have a look at the modern Wolf piece in the Financial Times as well because it was pretty scathing and was about. . I’m from this conservative government. . Well you know this is out there and in real time and you know frankly for our American listeners and viewers what goes on to morrow has a profound effect on what goes on in America. . We get a bank having the right decision and a many but. . I’ve got no idea. . John I met his son. . Start. . That’s what next. . Guess what. . You Matt Miller. . That’s important. . So that’s important. . No idea if Martin wrote this headline in the FTSE but at least the economic consequences of less trusts was the headline of that piece in the FTSE yesterday. . Well Danny Blanchflower over at Dartmouth he put this out. . Pretty predictable isn’t it. . David Ingles OK. . Yes. . But he said you know he said many interviews. . He’s discussed these disastrous economic policies of less trust as he said. . And he said that they’re in total disarray but it seems inadequate as pronouncements get worse daily. . I have never in my 50 years of doing economics seen anything as bad as this. . I want to see the complete package. . Looks like the two that we’ve heard of fear and in the cap on banker bonus says that’s going to get the wrong kind of headlines than the one that we heard of in the last 24 hours was on reducing stamp duty which anyone not familiar was just the transaction tax the pay when you buy purchase or a house in the UK time and that’s at different levels relative to how much that property costs. . Let’s see what the the complete package actually looks like. . Yeah. . You know when I was looking in Knightsbridge yesterday. . That’s why I came back a day late. . You know they said maybe the transaction tax would be gone. . You trying to buy to Kate. . Well you know that you can go on stamp duty. . Just Google it and have a look at how much you’d have to pay property taxes. . Sure. . Is it like real real money. . Yeah. . I mean you need the real money to begin with. . To find the Haslinda Amin is real money to one of five sterling or here in a very rich 113 store. . Are you waiting for it to decline a little bit more. . Yes. . Oh yeah OK. . Euro dollar ninety nine twelve. . But a stronger dollar in the mix. . Equity markets firmer. . Yields are lower. . All of this going into the Fed a little bit later looking forward to a Fed decides surveillance special a little bit later. . Do not miss this with the former vice chair Richard Clara in the studio with the three of us breaking down the decision and going over the news conference table. . Do you want any more than that drama. . Isn’t it just fantastic. . On Saturday and Chairman Powers going to cut. . He’s no he’s not calling. . And his job is only here to see Brad Stone. . He doesn’t care about it. . Doesn’t care about us. . He said to see Lisa of course. . From New York this is Bloomberg. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . Vladimir Putin is threatening to escalate the war in Ukraine even further. . Putin is calling up three hundred thousand reserve troops and vowed to use all means necessary to defend Russian territory. . He also hinted at the use of nuclear weapons. . Meanwhile the Kremlin is moving too swiftly to annex parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. . The feds ready today to hike again and to send a hawkish message for the third meeting in a row. . Policymakers are expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points and that would bring rates to the highest level since 2008. . Chair Jerome Powell is likely to hammer home that he believes further rate hikes are needed to tame inflation. . European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde says borrowing costs will rise more in the months ahead. . Speaking in Frankfurt Lagarde said the ECB has taken major steps to tackle inflation and she expects to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than 20 700 journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. . I’m Lisa Matteo. . This is Bloomberg. . There is some thought that we’re getting to pick hawkishness but that’s not going to move the market now. . It’s the earnings that are good to move the market in a realistic reset of where we’re going in this. . Alicia Levine there on the equity markets at the NY Mellon well she’s just given us so much insight particularly with her math foundations before we move to events with United Nations General Assembly. . Lisa I think we’ve got to look at what’s moving in the market. . And just one idea off of what John was mentioning on the Bank of England tomorrow. . If you take the sterling Lisa and you extrapolate it out the weakening has been so rapid that we see a one point one zero ninety nine extrapolation in a cup of good British coffee September 29. . I find that extraordinarily Emma Chandra the fact that people are talking about the potential for parity at a time where there is a one two whammy punch of an economic backdrop on forcing the Bank of England to raise rates and then a fiscal plan that has endless spending and tax cuts that’s leaving a lot of people wondering where the foreign investment is going to come from. . We’ll continue to monitor this. . And of course we go to our full reserve coverage this afternoon with Richard Clarett. . And we’re just honored the vice chairman would choose to give us extended comments. . I’m sure he’ll be delicate there and a delicate moment for Chairman Powell. . Right now it is a delicate moment for anyone ever in climate. . I will not mince words. . Michael Bloomberg who signs my paycheck has been a world leader and saying forget about the big picture and look at the smaller tactical realities. . He provided leadership at Paris a number of years ago on this with the mayor of Paris as a dog though and does again today with the earth shock prize. . Francine Lacqua was covering the story and will be part of selected panels there. . France. . Francine this is the effort of the Prince of Wales. . He is distracted with the sadness of his family. . What did the prince what did Prince William bring to the Earth Shot Prize Innovation Summit. . Well Tom this is about I think rallying the troops. . This is about finding small innovations as you say that could actually make a real difference in real world economies. . So this is very much at the city level. . This is incubators. . This is about getting funding to the right place. . But remember we’re here in New York. . And the overarching idea is that yes we see more and more climate disasters. . We see of course what’s burning. . We see the forest burning. . We see no water in the Rhine which is a whole host of problems. . But if you’re a leader and you focus of course on world poverty inflation the war in Ukraine this may not be appropriate anymore for you. . How is this prize in the work of Prince William changed because of the war because of the surge in energy not the threat to ESG but the idea of climate debate on a back foot due to the price of commodities and coal. . How has it changed the summit. . Well it’s changed it enormously. . And I think the biggest story to come out of the U.N. . in general was President Biden today meeting to attend the meeting to actually really laid out some of the groundwork ahead of COP 27 in Egypt saying actually had no longer time to go to that meeting. . Of course he said envoys but it’s not exactly the same thing as having the top boss and saying this is still a priority. . Again if you look at energy concerns if you look at the cost of living crisis there is a real concern which actually the United Nations director general addressed right at the start of NGO yesterday was a climate still needs to be left front and center. . The other question is that of course King Charles the third. . I know you were in London for 10 days covering of course the funeral of her his dear mother Queen Elizabeth. . It was a real spearhead in this. . And if you look at the U.K. . with all the concerns about you know sustainability that even have an energy minister who is not the biggest champion. . Let’s put it that way of climate change efforts. . It’s possible that the king has to step down for anything vocal and to really you know try and push this climate change agenda printing. . How has the shortage in commodities or maybe not the shortage but the higher demand on certain commodities changed the conversation in terms of what commodities will be necessary for the innovations to cleaner energy. . So this is one of the conversations that I used to have for example with the Glencore chief executive for last four years. . I mean remember they still have coal mines but a lot of these big miners and we saw some of the efforts for example from Fortescue keep on saying look it’s all well and good to transform some of these transition economies into something greener. . But you need cobalt you need some of the components that of course are needed not only not releases but some of the technology needed. . And he used to say the fact of the matter is that the government has not prepared for this. . He wasn’t talking about one specific government. . He said the U.S. . is not. . Feared for this. . The UK won even the Eurozone is not prepared with time. . And if there is still commitment from not only countries but private and public partnerships then you could see a lot of the mining companies again really ramping up some of the cobalt and some of the minerals really needed to use these components. . But again it’s about commitment and it’s about the money to be able to make sure that these places are secure. . Francine thank you so much. . Greatly appreciated from the Plaza Hotel and the Earth Shot Prize Innovation Summit as well. . And the time that we’ve got left here Lisa I think we have to frame back to just an absolutely tumultuous 2022. . It seems like we’ve lived two or three years just going through the years today. . And my great observation Lisa is we’re at a point where we’re not even to neutral yet based on all the experts we talked to. . It’s shocking. . And just to give you a sense of that more than a dozen central bank meetings and rate decisions will be had in the next 24 hours. . As we look out at all of these nations dealing with something very new relative to the past decade or two which is inflation. . And one way to kind of look at this reset this regime change that we’ve been talking about. . Thomas take a look at the total amount of negative yielding debt outstanding. . This is now becoming obsolete. . Save for Japan. . We now have one point nine trillion dollars of negative yielding debt outstanding according to Bloomberg indexes. . Just give you some perspective. . That was eighteen point four trillion dollars of negative yielding debt in December of 2010. . These are flows of money in the flows to stabilize. . We had this is try to get this up right now just from the beginning of the year. . It’s not year to date but it’s close enough to the peaks that we’ve had. . Lisa the Pacific Rim X Japan which is a fiction we all understand that a 9 percent depreciation the JP Morgan emerging effects indices which is more complex an 8 percent depreciation. . Those are big figure numbers in foreign exchange and for the United Nations and frankly for Chairman Paul. . Yeah. . An extreme visual version that John was showing earlier of 25 percent depreciation of the Japanese yen and the more violent example here. . But yeah especially the emerging nations. . How do you deal with also a double whammy of both higher commodity prices and importing inflation. . The fact that those commodities are paid for in dollars that are getting stronger becomes a very difficult equation especially as we head into a two year yield three point nine five percent. . That’s what I want to hear at 2 p.m. . and on to 230 in a press conference. . Lisa in fixed income what will you watch. . I mean what’s the real yield. . I’ll see how much people are expecting the Fed to stay out in front of inflation and not provide the same kind of accommodation that they have in the past. . And also just in terms of risk appetite how much if we priced in. . Right. . I mean basically if you get real yields continuing to climb that continues to make triple evers all cash. . You look good to some people who might make it to your 30s spread. . Wow. . Yeah. . Negative 41 basis points. . I did not realize at least. . This funny. . Isn’t that the greatest inversion going back. . Kate I have to look at that. . I I failed. . I didn’t do the math. . Maybe I’ll get it right by 2:00 p.m. . this afternoon. . Again we are honored that Dr. . Claire will join us in the 2:00 p.m. . hour. . Stay with us. . This is Bloomberg. .",

            "content": "I think in the next three to four months through the rest of this year it’s going to be a really volatile time. . You have to be opportunistic. . You have to be patient. . And you have to realize that this probably shouldn’t go on forever. . The Fed is going to face an increasingly more difficult challenge this time around. . when they pause, You want to be very wary about the relief rally. . You are fighting the Fed. . If you’re bullish it’s hard to find anybody that’s bullish now. . this is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . What a difficult couple of days. . Live from New York City for our audience worldwide. . Good morning. . Good morning. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz some Jonathan Ferro futures down a tenth of one percent T.K. . the last three days down 5 percent on the S&amp;P. . It’s really fragile and some of it is just the distribution of that down 5 percent. . The different sectors John the one shining light for not the bulls but I guess the less bears is the VIX really hasn’t moved. . John the sweat that’s out there the August sweat that’s out there says VIX 30. . VIX is at 26. . We’re playing off the data. . Some good news is bad news. . Apparently consumer confidence yesterday job openings they’re moving in the right direction. . Good news bad news. . The Fed’s going to do a whole lot more. . This market struggle we’re going to wait for the day that we start to see that today with ADP. . I don’t know what to make of ADP Jan. . I just don’t. . I’ll be honest. . I just don’t trust it. . But there’s a lot of bad data. . I do trust on it in America. . It’s just where are we into September. . I believe that’s tomorrow. . Well Lisa let’s start with the data out of Europe. . Bad news is bad news. . Yeah. . Nine point one percent consumer price inflation in the euro region coming in above expectations for 9 percent really fueling these fears and these expectations of a 75 basis point rate hike not by the Fed by the ECB. . And this is what we have to keep talking about. . All of a sudden we’ve reset expectations not just for Fed rate hikes getting bigger than expected but also over in Europe. . And what does that magnitude. . That’s sort of a joint effort really mean for market. . If he’s seen how much the German 2 year is meets first thing I looked at today up 930 basis points. . Tom. . Lisa that is unbelievable. . Up to one point two percent from down in the 20s 26 27 basis points to start the month. . And it’s not just there. . And it’s not just nominal yields. . If you look at real yields both in Europe and in the United States they’ve risen to the highest levels since the heart of the pandemic since the disruptions that really call the Fed into action. . How much are we seeing a resetting that’s been fully priced into the rest of the risk assets versus maybe not so much. . And this is why the equity markets struggling still this morning. . Good morning to you. . If you’re just tuning in with down about a tenth of 1 percent on the S&amp;P no drama on the Nasdaq at least for now up about a tenth of 1 percent. . Call it two tenths of 1 per cent higher yields higher gain though five or six basis points on a 10 year to 315. . Eighty eight euro dollar negative four tenths of one per cent. . Ninety nine. . Rameau sold about your world. . The bond market. . Yeah. . And this is how it really goes to the question you were asking yesterday. . You’ve been asking all year which is if the euro region. . If the ECB does raise rates by 75 basis points is that positive or negative for the euro. . Right now it is negative. . And it is also because the backdrop with the energy crisis today the NFP window is shutting for a three day maintenance. . Maybe maybe they’ll come back on line. . Gazprom is halting exports of natural gas to Europe during this period of time will come back online is the big question. . In the meantime you are seeing natural gas prices climb a little bit from the declines yesterday and the day before in Europe. . The reason why they declined is because there were there was evidence that stockpiles were building faster than people had expected. . But still in my mind this is the story heading into the fall. . This could really shape what happens in Europe and frankly globally with respect to sentiment 815 AM. . Tom you were talking about the ADP employment change. . They have rejiggered some of those expectations. . You don’t know what to make of them. . I think it actually takes on more import not necessarily because of how they’ve rejiggered expectations but because of the JOLTS data yesterday which was rather shocking. . It was expected to go down. . It did not. . It went up. . There were more openings that were posted to openings for every unemployed American. . This is not what the Fed would like to see. . They want to see tightening. . They are not seeing it today. . Perhaps we’ll get some indication of how Fed speakers are really speaking to that time. . I think it’s interesting. . There was a weak warning for research for the key. . No it was the Alan Ruskin note in the Beveridge curve. . And he says the U.S. . is different and it falls right into the JOLTS survey where you’ve got the idea that vacancies in America make us different and maybe we won’t see a higher unemployment rate. . Well this is the dream for the soft landing. . And we might get some more sense of how close or far away we are from Loretta Master who is speaking at 8 a.m. . Then we’re gonna be hearing from Laurie Logan. . I am not familiar with her. . She is the new Dallas Fed president and she’ll be speaking at 6:00 p.m. . and at 6:00 p.m. . we’ll hear from Rafael. . John I’m lost. . Didn’t they just speak to Tom. . Mr. and Bostic. . The three of them. . I mean maybe Laura. . Logan did but I think we met Laurie Logan some but didn’t on Friday just speak first. . Cups of coffee. . You’re I think we’ve heard from them a few times. . We’ve heard the message though pretty clear. . Tom Keene I think that’s the theme here for a lot of people. . They have stayed on the same page the same script repeated repeatedly every single one of them over the last few days. . John Williams as well of the New York Fed to your point about the markets like the two here has just broken out to a new high. . And with it the yen is right up against new yen weakness. . There is a tension out there. . It screams August very very close to 350 at 340 929 right now. . Christine noting joins us global chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Private Bank. . Christine we have taken out the June highs on a two year yield. . And the question a lot of people are asking is whether this equity market has the test the June lows. . Your thoughts. . Word from from our point of view if you think from a gross perspective we do think there is at least mild recession coming in the US and there is also a recession unavoidable for us in the Eurozone. . And from that perspective I wouldn’t be surprised if equity markets go down a bit further from here. . And we have been calling saying the June July uptick is probably not is a bear market rally is probably not where we end. . We have been arguing for by the next step. . And I wouldn’t be surprised if we see and if you look at the markets is another 3 4 5 6 percent depending on the market’s downside. . I wouldn’t rule out that we get there from our point of view. . Christian what do you do with bonds. . The chart that I put up earlier of price flat yield I guess up a little bit. . Global bonds on an aggregate basis are back eleven years. . What do you do with that institutionally. . Well from our point of view it has been right to be short duration and we kept it so from that perspective at least you can avoid to be super long duration as many investors sometimes have to be. . I think that’s number one. . And then you really need to look at quality from our point of view. . So you had discussed before if there’s a recession what does it mean to credit spreads. . I think we also need to look a little bit ahead as we don’t expect at least in the US the sustained long recession maybe as two Qantas three quarters. . I think if spreads are widening there is an opportunity. . If you look into investment grade I would be a bit more careful on the on the high yield side. . From our point of view we don’t think these levels which seem attractive but from our point of view is not where we want to go in right now. . Christian is Europe in a toxic place to invest in right now based on the energy backdrop and some of the volatility there or are you still seeing perhaps some opportunities even ahead of us. . Well I wouldn’t call it toxic to a very honest. . But of course it’s tough to be very optimistic about this point in time. . Let’s call it like this. . I think there are opportunities. . If you think the ECB is doing quite a lot as we do we can imagine over the next twelve months the ECB is moving from zero now to two which is quite something. . I would say there is I think opportunities in European financials which could profit from that. . But for the overall market it depends really on the energy crisis and how the winter plays out to be. . And from their perspective it’s not going to be easy for Europe the next month I think. . Question Did you just say that you’re investing in European banks. . Yeah I think European financials have upside because as I said if the ECB is moving they can profit from from the higher interest rate level. . And from that perspective now we had zero. . And I would expect the ECB not to look so much at growth because their target is really price stability and to move up in increasing rates. . And from their perspective I think that would be positive for them. . Yes Christine they’re can into a recession. . What’s more important here. . The rate hikes saw the economic backdrop. . Yeah but I think yeah. . Recession. . Yes. . But also here in Europe I think is not a recession which is a deep recession with which takes quarters and quarters. . From that perspective yes there is some implication and you have not seen a massive movement upwards although the market is pricing some of these VIX not all. . I think the ECB is doing more. . And from that perspective I think there could be some positives being overgrowth. . Looking at rate hikes from our point of view well that’s a trade for the brave. . Christine thank you sir. . Christine noted that if Deutsche Bank private bank Lisa Abramowicz getting longer European banks actually heard that from Sandlin to Brown over at BNP Paribas a number of months ago. . But that was at the June lows. . It wasn’t in the mess we’re in right now. . Look this has been the pain trade. . There is an upset argument especially if suddenly people have been complaining about negative rates for the past decade and you don’t have negative rates anymore. . And that could be a benefit. . But to your point hiking into weakness is it the weakness that matters are the hiking that matters. . And the currency market is saying it’s the weakness that matters because that is what the euro is responding to. . And I really have to take some cues from that. . And this is what the European banks have wanted some for a long long time. . They’re getting it though in a very very difficult. . John you’re being way too kind. . Their performance has been absolutely irresponsible. . Is that the board of directors level. . I just looked at the chart from my good friends at BNP Paribas. . Glad they support Tanners. . They’ve gone nowhere in 13 years. . 75 basis point hike is the expectation some at the ECB. . Now Capital Economics out this morning nine point one per cent CPI to Lisa’s point. . If you’re looking at these banks right now let’s put it all together. . T case questioning the execution. . Lisa you’re questioning the economic backdrop. . Is rates is rates enough to be supportive of stock prices for European banks. . Well just take a look at what we’ve been hearing from all of the banks. . Take a look at the capital markets activity. . You’re not getting the revenues from that because you’ve seen a massive slowdown perhaps a little bit of a pickup in the rally. . But otherwise IPO is whether it’s a debt issue and says whether it’s you know stock offerings whatever it is it is all stopped. . So then what is going to be the marginal driver. . OK. . Trading well there it’s kind of a little bit sketchy compared to where it has been traditionally because of how unpredictable it is. . There is the marginal driver John was the three cups of coffee ago. . The bank was moving 250 people into Asia. . Oh yeah. . Now they’re moving about a John Tucker. . They think John the guy that lives next door to you and that walk up you live in was a spec banker. . He’s toast. . Lisa has picked up on the right theme. . You mentioned Asia. . You mentioned some of the banks pulling back on deals folded into one story Brahma. . This is what the banks have got to do pull back. . Is there any surprise that Goldman and Morgan Stanley are now saying let’s go let’s go. . Covid can’t get back to work in September. . I especially it’s not a coincidence that it’s in tandem with the school starting. . Right. . Basically it’s like hey set up an excuse anymore. . Let’s go. . Last September it was let’s go. . And then it was like oh maybe not. . We can’t. . Maybe not this September. . Can I say it’s real. . Yes I say it’s real time. . Is it real this time. . Get to work. . See you in sir. . OK that’s nice. . Who done that. . Tom Keene. . Viviana Hurtado. . IBEX. . So let’s get back into radio banter I guess. . Shop futures unchanged from New York City. . This is Bloomberg. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word answers could get inflation in the eurozone is set a another all time high. . Consumer prices in the 19 country currency bloc rose nine point one percent in August from a year ago. . That beat the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. . And it strengthens the case for the European Central Bank to consider a jumbo interest rate hike when it meets next week. . The Justice Department says White House records held in a storage room at Donald Trump’s Florida home may have been moved before an FBI search in June. . The Justice Department says that could have been an attempt to obstruct the investigation. . In a filing that was a photo of files labeled Top Secret said to have been found in the former president’s office. . The government was responding to his lawsuit to appoint a special master to review the documents. . It’s the biggest two year decline in U.S. . life expectancy in almost a century and it’s blamed on the Covid pandemic. . Life expectancy fell by almost a year in 2021 after a decline of one point eight years in 2020. . The pandemic has been directly responsible for more than one million American deaths and shares of SNAP are falling today according to The Verge. . The parent of Snapchat plans to lay off about 20 percent of its nearly 60 500 employees starting today. . The stock already has fallen almost 80 percent this year. . SAP has been struggling with a slowdown in advertising spending. . And Mikhail Gorbachev is being remembered as the last leader of the Soviet Union who ended the Cold War. . Gorbachev died Tuesday at a Moscow hospital. . His attempts to shake up the Soviet Union’s political and economic system led to the collapse of the communist superpower. . Gorbachev’s career disintegrated in the process. . He was 91. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake and Rich. . We’re committed to getting inflation under control and there’s a path to get there. . A recession is obviously a risk in the process. . I’ll just say for context nobody ever canceled the business cycle so that when you say there’s a risk of recession it doesn’t have to be like a 2008 recession. . Thomas Falcon now the Richmond Fed president live from New York City this morning. . Good morning with Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz. . Some Jonathan Ferro futures just about positive on the S&amp;P after three days of losses on the S&amp;P 500. . Big losses as well were positive just two points up by not even a tenth of 1 percent. . It’s pretty clear to me to everyone that Fed officials are saying we’re happy with the market reaction. . We’re going to tighten. . We got to stay there. . We’re not going to back away. . At the first sign of success the hurdle to Paul’s laser is higher. . The hurdle to cap is higher. . You want to fight that on. . That’s that was your question yesterday. . And the answer that we heard from Sebastian Page was no. . If you want to fight that and think that we’re going to see gains good luck. . Probably getting your face ripped off in our Wall Street parlance. . The question I have is what have we priced in. . And some people are saying small caps for example have fully priced in recession. . What about big tech. . What about some of the drivers. . What has priced in recession and what hasn’t. . And how much are people going to really discern between the two. . Short and shallow seems to be the theme. . Tom Keene not just on the United States. . I just heard from Deutsche Bank that talking about a U.S. . recession and we still hear the short and shallow kind of story. . John I have huge problems because I’ve been wrong so many times. . You can line them right up. . Let’s start with 1980 and 81 in the double recession wrapped around Paul Volcker. . It’s hard to pick the recession though and define it. . John it’s even harder to get the magnitude right. . I couldn’t agree more Tom. . And I’m not here to say it won’t be a short and shallow one. . It’s not for me to say that. . I will say I think we should be open minded given how wrong I’ve been about so many different things over just two years. . We’ve got to go back to it. . We’ve got to 348 in the two years. . Quickly here John Yen is just this far away from yen weakness. . It’s a global issue right now. . We’ve taken out the highs of the middle of June June 14th on a two year yield. . We’ve taken them out 348 27 right now came really close to 350. . And back when we reached those kind of levels. . Yeah the middle of June this equity market was a whole lot lower. . Folks John Farrow has figured out that tuition in United States is a breeze. . This is the week where the tuition checks get written and the agony is out there. . There’s also agony in the political space. . Jack Fitzpatrick joins us at the end of August to reef shape to September and the election. . Jack Pugh does the best research on this. . It is stunning when they looked recently at the political typology of America how small the middle is. . They’ve got two surveys Republicans and Democrats somewhere between 23 and 28 percent of America is the middle. . Are they worth going after for these politicians. . In recent years I think you can find some evidence that there’s less focus on going after anybody who would describe themselves as persuadable. . A lot of this is about motivation of the base. . You see it in primaries. . At the same time you know especially just looking at President Biden’s speech last night. . I think there is a bit of a persuasion attempt there when you hear him talking about funding for the police and funding and support for the FBI and kind of going on a two track example that you know there are there are some seemingly winning political messages that still go for it. . Right. . Persuasion rather than motivation. . But overall big picture the last decade or so has been a way more of a shift toward getting your base out focusing on turnout. . And that’s a nash in a national trend. . Jack sort of a personal question. . I the clearest memory of sitting on the couch. . I believe it was a Sunday evening when Lyndon Baines Johnson stunned the nation and said he would not run for a second term. . Are we going to hear that tomorrow night. . That’s still a big question in Washington I don’t know about tomorrow night there. . If that were the case there’s still the question about the strength of somebody like Kamala Harris and who would be the front runner for the Democratic position. . I haven’t heard from anybody who feels confident that tomorrow is the night. . But you have heard some some some hints from Democrats who don’t think that the president is going to run again. . It came up in the New York race where Carolyn Maloney brought it up a couple times. . It’s something they’re not supposed to say but there is a bit of an expectation out there that the president wouldn’t run again. . I don’t know if that’s imminent or not at this point. . Just quickly Jack are we hearing anything about the student loan relief and whether that’s actually going to get legally challenged whether that’s actually going to go into effect. . There could be legal challenges but a lot of the pushback at this point has been Republicans talking about how the president should not have this power and what can be done in the future to take that away. . It’s a little hard to predict exactly how this would play out in courts if there is a legal challenge now. . But again a lot of the focus has been the political pushback and maybe some future legislative pushback depending on how much Republicans take back in the midterms. . Jack last the question we ask every now and again. . Where’s Janet Yellen. . I still still a little more low profile than you might expect for someone like her. . Same same story. . A lot of focus on the Fed. . Some talk from the president on the economy. . I wish I could come in here with an answer on the whole story about Biden and Yellen and and this relationship a bit quiet. . Jack thank you. . Down in Washington Jack Fitzpatrick T.K.. . It is utterly bizarre. . How did you manage to recruit one of the best labor market economists on the planet. . The former Fed chance to treasury secretary and then tumble weight to nothing. . I will never forget this. . I was standing in the early morning looking across the White House lawn. . This is Bush the younger. . And I realized that everything was run out of the White House. . And there’s been a modern disease. . I don’t know if it’s the same in London but there’s a modern disease here that everything gets run out of the White House and the cabinet members are figureheads. . Frankly Mr Blinken has been maybe a little less visible than Kissinger was to say the least John. . We’ve got a major issue on Twitter. . Tots are tweeting out that it’s a derby. . Is it a derby or a derby today with W and technically technically that makes it a London derby. . I’d say derby. . We talk about a North London derby between Tottenham and Arsenal. . And West Ham is an East London team Tom Keene Kent. . Tottenham is a north London outbreak up surveillance an app for this this afternoon John. . But West Ham they’ve basically sucked since Nate Shelly joined the team. . Right. . I think you’ll wonder whether he’s not. . Actually you’re right. . Well I just coach. . He’s up from Championship League. . No I think I think Mr. . Moyes will have a problem with that. . You ready to think that Ted last suffers for a lifetime. . Yeah he’s mentioned Wichita I think. . Waits to win the new season. . Come. . I have no idea. . I don’t know. . I mean you know it’s a documentary. . So they gonna maybe have a proper documentary and it’s got the season wrapped up. . Now we’ll see how Knight did at West Ham. . You’re ridiculous. . His positive two tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P. . I should go and do some research on six tenths of one percent. . You didn’t research right now in London. . You want to do a road trip to London. . Absolutely. . Just get on a road trip. . London from ISE like. . Count me out. . Count me out for New York City this morning. . Good morning. . Had AM radio seen on TV from audience worldwide. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance. . Live from New York City this morning. . Good morning to you all. . It’s the price action the shape of things so far early days. . Up about a tenth of 1 percent on the S&amp;P 500. . Call it two tenths if you want. . On the Nasdaq 100 up five or six tenths of one percent following the biggest three day rout on the S&amp;P 500 since June 14th down 5 percent over the last three days. . What happened back on June 14th. . Yeah it’s topped out for the year. . And we took out the closing high of June 14th just yesterday in this bond market. . Sees tens and 30s look like that. . We took out that June 14th tie on the two year not the 10 year. . Right now 348 27 new multi-year high say yields higher again by 4 basis points. . That’s biting eating into the equity market over the last couple days. . Is this fat. . This Fed communicates pretty strongly. . It’s ready to go again. . Go big if we have to off the back of better than expected data yesterday and then stay there. . The New York Fed president The Wall Street Journal yesterday found this very very fascinating that everyone’s on the same page at the moment about staying there and staying that home for a prolonged period of time. . The Fed speak. . I am baffled by the Fed speak frankly John. . We heard in Jackson Hole and we got a new round of it today. . We’re just going to hear the same thing. . I think so. . Possibly they’re all saying on the same script some if you think the Fed is fascinating confusing pick out whatever what you want the ECB. . I tell you what the hawks are in charge of the ECB right now that’s for sure. . The Bundesbank yesterday were talking about going big again even if you do fear recession. . They fear that. . Let’s go again this morning off the back of CPI come again with a nine handle. . The Bundesbank communicated again. . We need to act decisively. . So picture this. . You’ve gone on a German two year at the start of orcas from about 27 basis points that are close on the first trading day of this month to one point two percent. . So that’s a move of more than 90 basis points over the last month. . And yet the euro is weaker on the month not stronger. . At some ninety nine. . Eighty one you live. . This is Germany and France on the same page in terms of let’s go hawkish front loaded tone. . At the moment they are some. . And a difference between potentially this ECB and what we saw in the previous 10 years under Draghi specifically is that this time the hawks are in charge in a big big way. . Yeah they seem to be. . There’s no question about that. . Let’s jump to this right now. . I’m watching you. . And again which has moved here but still really front and center. . Mohamed El-Erian just out moments ago with a two year chart that was very smart showing the emotion of the moment. . If your head is spinning near the end of August and you’re worried about inflation gloom like Italy with 9 percent inflation this is flat out the interview of the day in recapitulate what we heard from David Rosenberg yesterday. . Look tell us in a different place. . He’s head of asset allocation chief economist at Wilmington Trust. . We’re thrilled he could join us today. . Look I thought your note was uncommonly cogent about the disinflation to come. . Put a date on it. . When does a disinflation show up. . Last month we had a really encouraging reading and CPI and then also in PCG clearly pulled down by energy. . But what we’re seeing is that weakening of inflation much slower advances and outright declines in a lot of consumer goods. . Airfares used cars and a lot of those things that have pushed inflation up over the past year to year and a half. . But it is kind of bi modal. . We still have a lot of pressure on shelter and rents and on food. . Those are running much higher than usual but we do see a lot of disinflation in those other categories. . And like the idea of a bi modal. . The theory here is any central bank including the Fred. . Given a bi modal distribution will always take the part of the bi modal that shows up later. . They’ll be massively ex post. . Is this a fed that reacts to a bi modal disinflation at the September meeting or at the September meeting of 2023. . Well I think at the September meeting they were likely to see a 50 basis point hike and that’s because we’re going to get another inflation number and I do expect it to be a little bit on the weaker side not quite as weak as July. . But what they’re set themselves up for is 50 basis points. . And I think Jay Powell was talking a lot more about the profile when he was in Jackson Hole. . That speech was clearly hawkish but he was really talking about the magnitude of hikes going forward. . It seemed like as you were just saying they’re all on the same page. . And all of those FOMC voters are pushing back on the futures curve which is showing rate cuts next year. . So I think in September we get that 50 basis point cut. . Another really important thing is what he said in July not a Jackson hole is that the rate cut rate hikes that they’ve already done. . We haven’t felt for full impact with them yet. . There’s a lot of tightening in the pipeline. . He said we’re going to see those come through and slow inflation down over the course of this year. . So look when you say that you’re already starting to see disinflation and even with the hawkish tilt of the Federal Reserve are you basically positioning around that and being more bullish on risk assets because the Fed won’t go as far as the market is currently pricing are used basically suggesting the Fed is going to because they are so exposed make a policy error and tighten into recession even if it’s not necessary. . Well we’ve never gotten so pessimistic that we went on or wait. . We’re neutral across our asset allocation in the equity categories and we have an overweight cash. . We’re looking to deploy that because even though our baseline is for inflation to slow down there’s clearly a lot of upside risks. . And the one that we’re really watching of course is wages and labor. . And Paul and the other FOMC members have talked about that if those wages keep pushing higher than they are more likely to keep tightening. . And even if inflation was slowing I think you get closer to a policy error and causing a recession. . Well just to make sure that I understand what you’re saying Lou. . In other words you’re neutral on equities or neutral on risk which is unusual for you because you are always invested. . Right. . And you’ve been overweight cash but now you’re looking to deploy that cash. . Does that mean you’re getting more bullish or does that mean that you have more conviction of the path of things going forward. . We’re not expecting a recession and we are getting a little bit more bullish but that big risk out there is definitely labor and we’re likely to see data later this week looking for an opportunity to deploy that cash a bias towards risk and a bias towards equities. . And I would think that that would come to us especially as valuations have come down. . But it remains to be seen how much later. . Labor market pressure to remain. . So where are you seeing opportunity most clearly. . In other words are you looking at big tech. . Are you looking at for example energy companies even as we see one of the consecutive monthly declines in oil prices. . On the on the fear of a slowdown globally. . Well if our baseline plays out then we would expect to see as Jonathan was just talking about we haven’t really seen long term rates move back up very much on the short end. . We’d expect the short end to come down a little bit and that would point towards some growth stocks that would point towards a recovering economy and the sectors that really benefit from that from long rates holding where they are a little bit more growth. . Look I tried it out yesterday one of the great series on the Bloomberg which is simply CPI not back to 1947 but our guesstimates back to World War 1 and inflation when it surges up is wildly stochastic and comes down quickly given the pandemic in the supply side realities the dynamics I should say. . Are we going to see another bout of stochastic in inflation reverse to disinflation. . We think there is a good chance that things come down pretty quickly and this gets back to transitory which I realize is a dirty word now but we are looking at a lot of inflation that’s been caused by that supply chain challenge from last year and also a lot of stimulus which of course is rolling off now. . Yeah. . So when you see Wal-Mart cutting prices when you see retailers saying you know we ordered too much stuff that’s where you could have it come down pretty quickly. . Again the risk Kevin Cirilli labor. . It also put energy in there. . I’m just asking for a friend. . But if you get out front of this the markets get out in advance. . Should I load the boat let’s say September 1st. . I don’t think that there is any reason to expect a recession. . Other than that that keep Vikings off the baseline inflation story plays out. . And if you get some weaker wages and I think we’re in pretty good shape to have an expansion going from here. . Right. . And that would argue for risk assets. . What do your managers Wilmington Trust think about cash. . Is cash an asset considering on conservative. . The shop is. . It’s certainly more that now than it was a few months ago for us but we’re looking for stronger returns if that inflation story plays out that way. . You think equities are better. . You guys were talking about credit spreads. . There might be some spots in the fixed income that are advantageous to especially with high yield yielding what it is right now from an asset allocation point of view. . We’re looking more on the equity side. . Like when does the office start to fill up. . What time. . Just thinking because Morgan Stanley and I sent out the memo. . They sent out a memo. . Goldman get back to work. . When do they get in the office like Raul is for us. . We’ve been actually been back for several months. . We’re going back for three days a week. . I’m just not quite this early. . And there’s there’s a few people around me. . You can’t see them right now but they’ll be. . And pretty soon they tell me. . Thank you. . I appreciate it. . Wilmington Trustee CAC. . Go on. . I wandered out to a tennis match last night. . How did that work out. . I was sitting in the seats. . I can watch Mets. . Dodgers next door. . I was sitting up so high. . And John there was no other topic in the chat. . I did. . With fans. . Thank you so much for coming. . Then work from home. . Can I just say that I signed on ESPN and the idea that you were sitting in the seats above. . So you write that courtside sat behind them around. . CARNEY Well I was good to see escaping this. . There were great seats. . Did you find them. . The young lady from France was the seat Shery Ahn show. . I don’t know. . Some of my people found them. . Yes. . Nice. . I don’t know this stuff. . Lisa and I can get our people to find any. . They said I got one seat. . You want to go. . And I said I got to take that bill. . And they said no you can’t. . The dog’s to sit on your lap. . Well I’m getting poor at home. . You know why. . Cable 116 27. . Oh I cannot afford to open this move. . This Lisa Abramowicz. . Look at this. . 116 26 I the low of the session was about 116 18. . You can go all the way back to 2020 in that big dislocation in the effects Mark. . And I’m sure you will remember that when we hit 114 or something like that in spring of 2020. . Lisa this is not a pretty picture for the UK. . Are you saying that it is because of the pound weakening that you did not go to the U.S. Open. . Is that your basically sterling savings I’m looking at now and I’m thinking maybe maybe is just some of the projections coming about. . The inflationary backdrop in the United Kingdom is beyond shocking. . It is beyond what we’re seeing over in the mainland of Europe. . And you do wonder how they’re going to deal with it. . What do you call continental Europe. . OK. . But I mean this is to me one of the biggest stories because how they deal with it is sort of a leadership role in terms of countering high gas prices with lower demand an inevitable recession. . This is going to make things much much harder for the Bank of England and I think for the ECB as well. . We’re seeing bigger and bigger expectations Tom with rate hikes from those two respective central banks. . And a currency is not stronger. . The weaker. . Yeah well you know that’s true John. . But you know Lisa seems stressed today John don’t you think. . In what way. . I think it’s the voice of a parent wondering if the children have the right calculator to go back to school. . Lisa are the kids properly calculated. . I don’t know. . They’re asleep. . And honestly I’m going on vacation. . So I’m not stressed. . You need the right against you later. . Eight fifty six. . Thirty two more days. . And then I’m not up 55 again. . So this is the last hurrah. . You coming back afterwards. . That’s the plan. . I guarantee you John. . I’m never going to. . Yeah exactly. . Then we CAC why she’s taking more vacation this summer than you and I combined. . It’s fantastic. . No regrets. . Futures up two tenths of one percent from a beautiful New York. .

In a court finding the Justice Department suggests there may have been attempts to obstruct the investigation by moving some of the papers. .

I’m paying attention what the Fed is telling us I think they’re wrong. . I think that Powells already told us we are operating policy without focusing on what’s happening on the supply side of the economy. . David Rosenberg the founder and president at Rosen Fact Research Line from New York City this morning. . Good morning. . Tom Keene. . Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro features positive just about up to 10 sunny S&amp;P after three data losses in the equity market amounting to about a loss of 5 percent to 5 percent in three days. . Remarkable stuff yields up 3 basis points on a 10 year 313 81 on a two year. . We take out a high set a year and the last 24 hours euro’s weaker. . Sterling is tape. . We take a snapshot. . St. . John wants sixteen ninety. . John what’s the emotion of 115. . Is that like Dow 10000 and that over stats 10000. . But it’s certainly troublesome for this Bank of England as they hike in interest rates and can’t gain any traction whatsoever. . Any affects Mark. . Does that mean to the people of the United Kingdom they’re not alone. . Well if you’re importing inflation now some you’re import a whole lot more with a weaker pound sterling. . Unbelievable. . We’re going to do right now. . And this is a great honor to have Julie Norman with us. . She’s the co-director of the UCLA Center on U.S. . Politics but is really definitive on continental Europe and of course terrorism and the study of the Middle East as well. . Julie we digress today to Mr. . Gorbachev. . Why does Mr. . Putin hate him so much as it’s just as simple as he’s the guy that gave up the Soviet Union. . Well that’s certainly a lot of timing. . What we see playing out obviously with Russia and Ukraine today you can destroy a direct through line back to Gorbachev and the dissolution of the USSR back in the day at a time when cotton was just kind of coming into his own in the KGB and just saw that dissolution as a complete tragedy. . And I would say to it wasn’t just the dissolution but also the changes that Gorbachev made before that the opening up of the media the opening up of multiparty election writings of dissonance all the things that Putin we know has brought back. . Why don’t want to do a history lesson here. . But the idea of Gorbachev and then Yeltsin who is one of the things I’ve most been wrong on in my career we come to Putin who’s after Putin. . If you look at transfer of power of Gorbachev to Yeltsin and the rest of the dance of the Russians how can you choose who’s after Putin. . Do you have any idea. . I think it’s a tough question Tom and partly just because Putin as we know has consolidated power so much around him and through the inner circle of the party that it’s not like looking at you know another country that would say who’s who’s competitive in elections or who’s popular or something like that. . It’s a very close circle and it’s one that we know Putin is going to hold onto as long as possible himself. . So even the timeline on that is anyone’s guess. . Virtually Gorbachev’s death really raises a question about whether Russia could be a democracy. . Whether democracy has failed as a project in Russia is Putin’s legacy that whoever follows him will also be an autocratic leader because of the legacy of a democracy that did not take off in the way that many people hoped. . Well it’s a good question. . And your Gorbachev himself you know obviously from the west is hailed very much as a hero. . But in Russia at the time of his you know at times and his office up till now was very unpopular because even in the early 90s period he could not deliver on his promises internally to what people were hoping for. . And that was the economic side as well as the more political side. . So I think Gorbachev was hoping that there was growing pains would be temporary. . Obviously things have gone another direction. . I think in the long drive of history we know that doesn’t mean a country is doomed to a certain trajectory forever. . But it does probably indicate that it’s going to be on that route for at least the coming years with someone like Putin. . And again the kinds of people he has put around him are in charge. . Julie heading into the fall the focus very much will be on Europe and the natural gas situation whether Russia’s going to stop some of the exports to that region. . Nordstrom One goes into maintenance for three days. . Will it come out is the big question. . What is the advantage for Russia to just cut off supplies. . I mean is it cannibalizing from all of its future revenues. . Well it certainly seems that way. . But it’s also the main area where Russia from the beginning of this crisis has had real leverage and putting the squeeze on Europe putting the squeeze on the U.K. . really just showing where they have this political where they have this economic as well as political muscle. . And so we see them leveraging nod. . And I think a lot of this is also tied up with peripheral issues as well. . So relations with China relations with Iran. . These are things that are kind of helping some of their allies bringing some of them closer at the same time. . Julie take us from the really I think pretty poor coverage in America of Ukraine away from the generalization that the Russian military effort is stodgy slow motion very doctrinaire and the Ukrainians are making it up as they go etc etc.. . That’s a stereotype. . What’s the nuance of Curson or the nuance in the South etc. . The nuance on the Baltic Sea between those two forces. . It was I think it’s a good question because there’s a lot that we don’t know and a lot of the coverage that we are seeing is of course telling the story that I think a lot of viewers in the West want to hear. . And in reality the war as we know is already quite long. . We know that is trying to recruit more people into the army as it seems as a thing that’s going to be ongoing in Carson for example. . It’s unclear exactly how much Ukrainians had been able to push back or not. . There’s a lot of controversy right now around the nuclear sites that the U.N. . is going to be has been living in there today to try and stabilize that. . So there is a lot of errors especially in the kind of the eastern part of the country where Russia has control that Ukraine is trying to chip away at. . That is just going to be an ongoing slow slog moving into the fall in the winter. . And it’s it’s attractive to want to see these victories. . And of course some of them are there. . But but I think this is going to be a very long conflict as many as many others have said as well. . Judy thank you as always. . Gerry Norman of UCLA Center on U.S. . Politics. . Lisa the consequences of this war will be found for a long long time and these sanctions off the back of it. . Look at what’s happening in the U.K. right now. . You do have to ask the question how long would resolve this coalition last as the economic pain starts to materialize even more less trust. . Who is the leading candidate to be the next prime minister in the U.K. . is talking about plans to cut taxes and raise spending. . Charlie Bean the former deputy governor of the Bank of England was on with our team in London earlier this morning and talked about the risk of a large sustained deficit in the medium term and how investors may start to think the U.K. . doesn’t look like such a good place to invest. . What’s been happening in the U.K. yields a much much higher. . Sterling is much much weaker. . What’s the central bank’s role in all of that. . It’s a big question mark right. . This is unprecedented and it’s a very difficult place for them to be in. . The question that you ask though about where is the resolve. . How much is there and how much pushback do you start to get as the economic pain deepens. . That goes to Jennifer Granholm point the energy this energy secretary in the United States raising issues with the exports of natural gas from the United States to Europe because it raises the prices domestically in the United States. . At what point does some of the alliances splinter in the face of economic pain that is very real and very difficult to combat from the central bank level. . It was the first question Tom asked yesterday when we went through that story. . Tom is the Department of Energy on the same page as the State Department and this White House in America. . That’s the way it is. . But I think John to your point about currencies and I think a lot of our listeners and viewers John said well why do we follow Sterling. . Who cares. . It’s the litmus paper of the system. . John I didn’t know this. . I just did the math here. . What you can do quickly on the Bloomberg your sterling John. . February 24th. . 14 percent. . Depreciation Brad Stone stunning. . That’s one stunning one. . Heck of a move to help. . That’s for sure. . Futures are up about a third of 1 per. . The Nasdaq bouncing back by eight or nine tenths of one percent. . We’ll break this down with the brilliant Julian Emanuel of Evercore. . He’s going to join us in about four minutes time from New York City on TV and radio for an audience worldwide. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance. . I think in the next three to four months through the rest of this year it’s going to be a really volatile time. . You have to be opportunistic. . You have to be patient. . And you have to realize that this probably won’t go on for a bit. . The Fed is going to face an increasingly more difficult challenge this time around when they pause. . You want to be very wary about the relief broadly. . You are fighting the Fed. . If you’re bullish it’s hard to find anybody that’s bullish. . Now this is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . It’s. . Where did all the bulls come from New York City this morning. . Good morning. . Good morning from audience worldwide. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance Life on TV and radio alongside Tom Keene and Lisa Abramowicz. . Some Jonathan Ferro features up a quarter of 1 percent on the S&amp;P on the Nasdaq 100 up seven tenths of one percent T.K.. . We have a bounce. . Will it stick. . It’s a bounce in the data really speaks volumes. . We’ve had you know I get the equity bounce and all that with the VIX twenty six point two one shows it’s not too much agony but the two year yield John earlier this morning that’s a big deal. . And the Japanese yen tells me this is a global coordinated system into September. . Yesterday good news was bad news Lisa. . This time around this Friday if we get bad news it’s not just bad news. . Well not necessarily. . I mean basically if you get a disappointing jobs number does it give a bit of a relief to people who are expecting that perhaps it’s a 75 basis point rate hike by the Federal Reserve in September. . That said what are we really looking at here right now. . You’re just talking about this before John. . Longer term inflation expectations are actually tumbling since Fed Chair Jay Powell speech. . People believe that they are going to get inflation under control much more significantly. . And that’s perhaps why you’re seeing a little bit more of a lift in tech stocks because people are seeing oh perhaps there’s more of a case for those in a slow growth kind of environment or yield to eventually go back down. . I think they’ve all been sent the same hymn sheet because they’ve been singing from the same. . One thing about my for the last couple of days have said the last the last couple of days they’ve said the same thing. . Right. . And hold and hold for maybe a year perhaps even longer term than that. . And that’s been the forceful message of this Fed over the last week or so. . That’s the front parlor game. . And I’m sorry John the data matters. . But John let’s be clear as we go into the jobs day and really this is the beginning of the study of Friday’s jobs. . This ADP this morning matter for Jerome Powell. . I don’t think so. . Strange when that one time because if you ask people if ADP matters Lisa that turnaround is saying no it doesn’t. . And then sometimes we end up trading on it. . Then once you get to Friday ADP no longer matters. . OK just focus on pay. . I think it’s fascinating that because we’ve all been saying the ADP doesn’t matter. . ADP took a break and they said we’re not going to put out data for a couple of months. . And now they’re coming back and they’re saying now it matters. . So let’s see what happens and let’s see whether that date attracts a little more closely. . It might be a pivotal moment. . This might be a really exciting day. . It may well be or not. . Probably not. . Do you think I could take a break like ADP. . How many months was that. . Couple of months. . Seven months. . Yeah. . To reassess. . You got to reaching methodology to date and start with Sterling. . You want me to start with standing early. . OK. . I think I going to start with equity. . So let’s do that Tom because the team’s not ready. . How far up sterling just yet. . So futures up two tenths of one percent on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq 100 up around six or seven tenths of one percent. . Eurodollar 99 83 with negative a third of 1 percent. . So that’s a weaker euro in the mix. . And we’ve talked about pants standing a couple of times this morning. . Lisa 116. . Twenty. . Negative. . A third of 1 percent. . Hiking into weakness. . And that weakness is the more prevalent story especially as we look at some of the potential projections for inflation in that region 18 percent over at Citigroup. . Whether or not that’s just a marketing ploy will have to be debated later on the show today. . Nord Stream one that goes off line for three days for maintenance maybe gets longer. . That is the question whether Russia is going to stop exporting natural gas to Europe. . We’re seeing a little bit of a lift to natural gas prices but yesterday and the day before huge decline in natural gas prices. . And I think this was really underpinning some of the attempted a bullish feeling at least to start the trading day as people took a look at a concerted effort by EU members to get some sort of structure for the electricity markets but also stockpiles rising faster than their previously expected 815 AM. . Do we care. . I guess we’ll be passing that through. . ADP putting out their numbers after taking a break for a couple of months. . How much is their new methodology making it more relevant and giving a sense of what we can expect on Friday with jobs report. . Yesterday’s JOLTS data was much more important than people had previously thought. . It was jobs Tuesday because we saw that all those openings climb in a way that people were not expecting. . Now nearly two job openings per every American that signals that there still is a lot of momentum behind wage gains. . Right. . That is the concern is that this is going in the opposite direction of where the Fed wants to see. . This is not labor market weakness. . Is this the exact opposite. . Wage gains Joel Weber. . This is a big concern for some people even though it’s good news. . Right. . This is why good news is bad news today. . Fed speak. . It continues. . Lots of it. . We’ve been hearing a lot from Fed speakers. . Well they give us any new insight or will they just continue singing from the same hymn sheet. . Laura Ambassador Cleveland Fed President Laura Logan. . Dallas Fed President Rafael Bostic. . Atlanta Fed President. . All lining up to give a sense of what they’re looking for. . I’m still looking for some insight John in the balance sheet and how that’s going to potentially affect things. . So I might be calling this ADP Wednesday. . ADP once again it’s not going to get it. . That’s not to say oh a wins. . It’s not going to work. . Lisa thank you. . That’s where there’s chief equity and quantitative strategist Evercore ISI. . Jillian you call this the gray zone one of just a gray zone. . The gray zone is look we had a reasonably. . Epic bear market from January to June. . That was not only the epitome of don’t fight the Fed but the markets took the hawkish narrative and ran with it in an unprecedented way causing you know if you look at the stock bond quadrant you know the biggest losses in the combined 60 40 portfolio that we’ve seen in years. . And then it all turned in June and into a few weeks ago. . And now we’re at a point where do we go back to the. . Don’t fight the Fed mantra. . Or do we think about it and we think about the unfolding you know perhaps the Fed easing off which is not at all in the script right now. . Right. . Even though people who else counter that this is important to that point in the last twenty two hours we’ve heard your David Rosenberg and look till you willing to trust bull scream the disinflation story. . Edward Hyman screams at home and says we’re going from age 9 ish and we’re going down not to 2 but we’re going to 4 percent. . What does your world do if we get an at home and disinflation stocks do well stocks ask about do what are they. . They do double digit. . Well do they roar. . Not in this environment. . Not yet because that likelihood is that if that happens Ed’s view of 1 percent GDP is probably where we are in 2023 and that’s still a constrained environment. . But I want to make a point here. . OK you’ve got three Fed speakers today. . OK. . And if you think about it going back to the first hike in March every time there was an extreme sort of market response to anything that Paul said both either hawkish or dovish the Fed speakers come out and have moderated the tone. . It’s going to be very informative. . What did they say. . Can we hear him on every day. . The day. . I mean just to lighten it up here people can talk to his people so far. . Julian to your point the other Fed officials have absolutely doubled down. . They have not watered down Jay Palace message at all. . They’ve gotten quite the other way. . How does that inform your assertion which is rather dramatic that the growth led rally is over. . You’re basically repudiating this idea that big tech can rally in the face of perhaps more economic weakness even with the Fed that is determined to hike rates. . Well and again it’s surprising to the extent in the last couple days how much the other Fed officials have doubled down. . But what it does is it just when when you look at yields you know they’re going up on the short end rates. . But also when you think about the fact that tomorrow we’re going to start 95 billion a month in Kutty. . It’s hard not to make the case that yields on the long end are going up as well. . And again as we’ve seen in this positively correlated stock bond well that’s a massive headwind for stocks particularly for growth stocks. . What kind of downside are you seeing. . Julian. . I would say the key here is does the consumer hold in in September. . If you think about it one of the anomalies of this year is that consumer sentiment has been absolutely abysmal the entire year. . And spending has been fine. . Obviously that’s one of the strange this is about a new inflationary environment. . But if you think about it you know could you get into this idea. . We’re back to the office. . We’re back to school. . September is challenge. . That is the kind of environment if the consumer holds in. . We could be OK. . We know. . But if not there’s a potential retest of the lows in store. . Well this is the bigger question Judy. . And it’s not about whether inflation comes down to 4 percent. . It’s what price are you willing to pay. . It’s got inflation down to 4 percent was unemployment when inflation comes down to 4 percent. . What’s happened to GDP when inflation comes down to 4 percent. . Janet it’s not that easy is it just to say we come down to 4 percent. . That’s good for stocks. . No not at all. . And look if we’ve learned anything this year or I’d argue the last two and a half years is that the tail outcomes. . You know when people talk about black swans they happen a heck of a lot more frequently than we would have ever imagined. . And that’s really what you’ve seen to a large extent this year. . And so you know there’s a lot of different potential outcomes as we head into the fall. . We started trying to say super super open minded about this. . Gillian can you help us do that. . The short and shallow consensus around a recession in America. . How would you the team thinking about maybe the tail risk here. . So we continue to think that you’re not likely to have a recession. . But if Ed’s view of 1 percent GDP next year is correct and we see a symmetrical pardon me symmetrical risks are around that number it’s still going to feel for asset markets from time to time as if there is a recession. . That argues for higher volatility. . And then again you know Ed said it a couple days ago. . It argues for humility and forecasts as that sent out the memo. . It won’t get back to the office. . Didn’t do it. . There’s a real question. . Did he do a Solomon memo you know day after Labor Day where we’re where guns blazing get back in the ties or back of notes as wound some. . Did you notice that message when young Cassius was with us from Goldman. . I noticed the tie was back up only after the incident. . It was a tie of our own when the time was yes I was the pandemic young took it off both times. . Go some the gone though. . Shery Ahn. . Thank you. . Good to see you. . On note to the open. . I noticed that the bow tie and your men from time on to the man from Del Monte. . Yep. . Did you catch up with them at home. . No I didn’t. . She’s a lot of pain and to be honest she can’t hold a racket. . It’s that simple. . The blisters on her hands. . Yeah. . Wicked. . Wicked. . I mean not a problem for the last year. . Two or three. . It’s like they had to take a break in the middle and put seven bandages on or whatever not get crushed. . No good. . I tell you what. . There’s something going on in the secondary market in U.S. . Open in the U.S. . Open on the ticket front. . This just so I agree. . There’s something we done. . I got very lucky. . There’s something really strange. . You know if you have any theories please. . My theory is roto e-mailed and said no I buy this. . I said some 20 percent. . Some of these tickets have quadrupled. . You know you’re right. . Something really odd coming on the secondary market. . Absolute ticket master. . We want a conversation with you when you’re available. . Features up to 10 Juliette Saly Day from New York. . This is Bloomberg. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word I’m risking GUPTA Inflation in the Eurozone has set another all time high. .

The drift function in currency this morning is really pretty. . I just looked at a fancy chart and sterling John and I won’t mince words. . It’s grim job. . We’ve got to get out front of the real yield. . The real yield is very quietly moved up. . It start out to new high but the 10 year real yield America is an unspoken story. . The end of this summer I think it was Lisa’s chart the last 24 hours. . Tom Mackenzie. . Yeah. . Well she’s out front of you know where. . She’s out front of everyone on Twitter. . Lisa Abramowicz. . What a move. . That speech. . Yeah it’s been dramatic. . And how much is that. . What’s underpinning the move that we’ve seen an equities. . This is a reassessment of how far the Fed will go how much pain they’re willing to inflict on an economy to get inflation under control. . Tom if you go back to June highs to stocks below Ben they belong at June lows. . And that’s something we can discount Syria and we’ll see if that’s the exception of the rule. . S&amp;P at 4000. . Exactly. . Jack Frost Patrick now on Washington Jack. . The silly season starts in the old days. . Politicians kiss babies. . How did they reach out to voters. . Now give us a social media or advertising update on the crazy messages we’re going to see on the dash to November. . You know in terms of crazy messages especially that speak to the modern era of campaigning the Pennsylvania Senate race has been very interesting a bit surprising. . You’ve seen Mehmet Oz the Republican nominee Dr. . Oz go after John Fetterman the Democrat a couple times talking about his health. . Fetterman had the stroke. . And you know there was a Twitter ad that ISE put out using the word crazy saying he did. . He’d kind of lost it and implying he had not fully recovered from it. . It’s the kind of thing that previously you would have thought they’d hope that a superPAC independently would do that kind of attack. . You wouldn’t want your name on it. . I don’t know how that’s going to play out there. . There’s some surprise that ISE has has taken that line a couple times now. . But yes social media especially pandemic and post pandemic is a huge focus on social media and what you can do with that and how that undermines some traditional thoughts about fundraising and how that plays into campaign strategy. . But the Pennsylvania Senate race probably made my favorite strange example of that lately. . Jack was so important. . Here is the stereotype as the Republicans have money the Democrats don’t. . Am I right that that’s not true this time around. . Yeah you know for a while now Democrats Democrats really were the first to use social media and sort of the modern Internet as a means of big time fundraising. . Obama first Obama campaign was out earlier than Republicans on that. . And a lot of this has been shaken up again with social media and the 2016 race. . Trump cell funding to a significant degree and relying on social media more than you know TV advertisements. . If you remember 2016 Jeb Bush’s people were talking about shock and awe hoping that they could raise so much money that even Marco Rubio wouldn’t dare to run. . Obviously that was not the case. . And so the presence of social media and the digital strategy and the prominence of that has made it totally totally different than the traditional fundraising focus that was in place for a long time. . Jake before we let you go we have to really mark a moment that we kind of missed which is that the pandemic is officially over. . That seems to be what the new CDC guidance has been saying. . And it certainly is the case with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley saying get back to work. . You don’t have to test if you’re not vaccinated. . Cool. . You don’t have to wear a face covering. . And oh by the way if you’re exposed as somebody who is positive just wear a mask. . If you get sick wear a mask. . I mean it basically is it’s your responsibility not a public health concern anymore. . Is this a watershed moment. . I don’t know but a watershed moment. . But we have been inching toward a time period in which medically the pandemic would not be over and it’s it’s not it’s not gone. . It’s we’ve still got much a much more significant issue on our hands than something like the seasonal flu. . But the you know medical professionals and politicians I think had the sense that there would not be a hard end there wouldn’t be a mysterious disappearance of the virus like has happened. . At times the Spanish flu for example and they were going to have to make some decisions about when to a little bit ignore it. . And that raises hard questions about funding for vaccines what the U.S. . role is internationally how seriously they take that. . The last six months or so has been just a series of examples of lawmakers taking the. . The push for vaccine testing. . Funding that kind of thing less and less seriously until it just kind of fell off the table. . So we we have gotten to the point where there’s a significant delta between the the medical reality that it’s still there. . Look our political and cultural willpower to take very significant steps that people have gotten tired of. . Jack thank you. . Jack Fitzpatrick that down in D.C. . Prema I think government Morgan Stanley hoping how can it suffer its get back to work in a big way isn’t it. . Get back to the office. . It’s basically there is enough remedies and years Nephi collective immunity that you’ll be fine. . And if you’re not fine. . Well then we’ll just have to deal with that as a natural consequence. . And that seems to be the Zeit Geist use Tom’s word of frankly the nation. . But people are sick of it. . They just want to get back to some sort of sense of normalcy. . And slowly but surely you’re seeing that around the country and you certainly see businesses say look you can come in and go to the city to go out to eat or go to a show. . You can go back to the office. . I think bosses are sick of it. . Let’s be very clear. . Thank you John. . I hate to say this. . I’m not gonna pick on any individual bank but sort out the office maybe just sort out the booths that people. . I say careful John’s home and make him more comfortable if you want them to come back. . Welcome home. . The architectural channel. . I’m also I’m just saying I think Chad I’m just saying all the good work of the doctors. . I head through the Covid yesterday 473 people died. . To me that’s a little elevated as an amateur. . But still it seems to be a number that’s trending up ever so slightly of the 1.0 four million deaths that we’ve had John. . Jack’s perfect statement the science and the politics is miles apart. . And John to your point a lot of companies are doing that. . They’re rejiggering their offices to make them look nice. . But that’s actually what’s happened. . Now you make him more exciting. . We’re going against the trend folks. . Very exciting. . All of us come back home. . So I’m going against the trying to come back on features epithet on the S&amp;P from New York. . And this is blowing back. . If the pandemic is over we amount in the same room so we’re going to figure out. . I’ve been lobbying for John. . I’ve been lobbying for it to make that happen. . That’s when I know the pandemic is truly unfair. . We’ll share our time. . We’ll run out to sit together for the first time in like two and a half years. . Pictures right now. . Positive quarter of 1 percent on the S&amp;P 500 on the NASDAQ 100 up six tenths of 1 percent. . The equity market bouncing back. . I’ve talked about the losses over the last three days brutal losses over the last three days down about 5 percent on the S&amp;P 500 down a whole lot more on the Nasdaq. . So a bit of a bounce back. . A bounce back though after which suffered over the last week off the back of what’s happened in this market. . The bond market two stents and thirty two year yield taken at the height of the year. . The June 14th close yesterday at the close. . And we add to it again this morning four basis points came very very close to 350 on a two year. . Right now 348 0 7 that move is supporting the US dollar as well. . Even though we’re seeing moves across the Atlantic in Germany and the U.K. . yields higher we’re seeing the currencies weaker weaker weaker. . The dollar index just off levels we haven’t seen since 2002. . Euro dollar just about holding on to parity negative a tenth of one per cent sterling came very very close to a 115 handle 116 35 right now some down two tenths of one per cent. . And if you look at month to date chart look at a month to date chart of yields in the UK and Germany. . You’ll see this just massive moves. . And yet what have you seen in the currency. . Weaker currencies. . And that’s the big day out home for these central banks looking to bring in bring in big time inflation. . Francine Lacqua John Tucker 30 seconds on Italy eight point two percent survey. . Wow 9 percent inflation. . That’s distant Mark Gurman. . A look at headline in Europe some a nine handle for the whole of the eurozone. . And that’s why the Bundesbank is pushing this idea of making a decisive move saying that they shouldn’t fear a recession. . Well we now assume Tom that we’re going to have a recession and they’re going to hike aggressively into it after. . Bear in mind some you mentioned where CPI is in Italy and Germany where it is in the eurozone. . Rates are still a 0 percent. . And that’s how she why this ECB and many the hawks on it are looking for a big move come next week. . Go with that. . I just sorry. . Europe is unique and I think it’s underplayed John. . There is a war going on. . There’s a war going on. . No. . We’ve said that repeatedly. . We’re going to feel the consequences of that war for a long time. . To Thomas you’ve got a supply side problem and you’re trying to address that with interest rate hikes. . Does it make sense that we’re only talking about a short and shallow recession. . Well that because they could be chasing that sale for a long long time trying to get that down. . I think that the combination of those dynamic parts John is when does the Fed see enough data or another central bank where they ease up on the idea we’ve got to get to a real rate regime we’re comfortable with. . And like Rosenberg Julian Emmanuel at home and and others are saying this is going to be the surprises. . What’s the price they’re willing to pay to get inflation down. . One how much pain are they willing to tolerate. . Same point. . Do they. . That’s the issue. . Do they get inflation down. . Or does it decline itself. . If that’s the case that’s a beautiful thing and risk is off to the races. . Do you think that’s going to happen. . No not going to predict. . I don’t think it’s the base case trying to predict. . That’s not the consensus view. . I’m not going to predict. . I think you’re in a better position to protect that game. . So at the moment versus that. . Well I got to go the top because nature shows you know I mean the West has been off. . Yeah. . Of Ted Lasso who manages West Ham. . And maybe not in a not in the real world some anyway. . That’s the cross asset price action. . Lisa is very tolerant very patient. . Hi Lisa. . Hi. . I watch. . I think you guys discussed your theoretical road trip to a fantasy show. . It has to do with football. . It sounds really illuminating. . What I’m watching is actually to this point of short and shallow. . One of the reasons behind this conviction has been because of the strength of the consumer. . The strength of the balance sheet of both companies as well as individuals in the United States more than other places. . HP reported earnings yesterday after the bell. . Fascinating downgrading their forward forecasts as a result of less demand for personal computers and printers. . Also seeing less demand from companies as well. . This has been a consistent theme. . We’ve seen this in semiconductors and we have seen this in the hardware companies. . How much is this portend. . Something bigger versus just all of these people bought all their computers during the pandemic. . I don’t need them now but Bath and Beyond shares absolutely tumbling after this company failed to sell more shares at an unspecified time in a specified amount. . Those shares down nearly 18 percent in premarket trading and SNAP shares down 7 percent or nearly 7 percent after Verge yesterday reported that this company is going to be cutting 20 percent of its 60 500 person workforce. . How much does this portend ongoing job cuts. . Right. . We’ve been seeing this in some of the tech companies. . SNAP of course sort of the social media companies getting hit by a lack of advertising something to watch. . How much is this an anecdotal story versus something more mainstream. . I’m also watching the energy sector because what we are seeing is the third monthly decline of. . Losses in the oil space have declines in the oil space which is the longest streak of losses going back to 2020 we are seeing this reflected in the prices of some of these shares. . Exxon down 2 percent and Chevron two point three percent. . Devon Energy two point seven percent ahead of the open in premarket trading. . How much is this the ongoing trend that will turn out to be wrong. . And Tom this is what we keep hearing from people. . They’re selling energy to raise some cash to go into brand of small caps or other more beaten up areas. . How much is that really going to be the theme heading into winter. . As you see increased demand and possibly just the lack of supply to meet that given some of the international constraints. . International is what I would look to to me. . You can’t guess where there’s some surveys or done. . Alisa push in 30 40 years ago that it’s the toughest market to predict. . I mean it’s just energy is just totally gray. . A nightmare. . Totally. . We’re now going into the bond market. . We look at the end of September. . It’s been so quiet. . What’s it like. . It’s like Rip Van Winkle except we’re going to call it Rip Debt Winkle because that’s what it is. . It’s been asleep. . Deborah Cunningham wakes up for September. . Global liquidity markets officer at Federated erm has revealed she could join us this morning. . What does CFO do in September. . I get the idea. . Equities. . Everybody comes back they recalibrate blah blah blah. . What does CFO do about the issuance of bills notes and bonds come September. . Well I think they look at what the plans are for the rest of the year where they’re going into the next year and decide on short term long term how much you know in in what’s that gray market they’re issuing. . Do they think we’ll we’ll see debt come into the marketplace. . I agree. . Robert Schiffman has a stunning essay out on Amazon at Bloomberg Intelligence this morning of the financing that they could do for a 100 billion dollar possible transaction. . Just to get the firepower in your world is a lot of debt going to be issued just to get the firepower ready. . You know I think there have been companies that have had have already termed out some debt taking advantage of what they think are the shortest or the lowest rates that are going to be you know available to them for a while as inflation continues to be an issue. . But I don’t think it’s every everyone I think you still got you know asset backed issuers. . I think you have corporates. . I think you have financials that are all looking still for additional debt financing in the short term sector as well as maybe the short to intermediate area of the bond curve over the next over the rest of this year and into 2023. . Deborah you’ve got a front row seat in one of the biggest questions in market is coming up particularly starting this week with the acceleration of the runoff in the balance sheet and what that will do with respect to the removal of liquidity in the markets how much that will inject volatility into a lot of the banking sphere in particular. . What’s your view in terms of what you’re seeing on the ground with liquidity exiting certain aspects of the market that really have been fueling some of the froth here areas. . Well certainly you know it’s been going on since June. . Now it’s going to double you know starting next month starting starting tomorrow. . And it’s been masked by other issues in the economy. . So you know what we have seen so far from a roll up of treasury and mortgage backed securities has already been overshadowed by the increasing rate environment that we’ve experienced and the sell off in those securities. . In response to that you know the expectation would be as they double it you’re looking at something that has an impact of probably another 25 or 50 basis point like tightening by by the FOMC. . And as such you know where where where are the buyers. . Who are the buyers. . We have from at least a Treasury perspective. . However been in you know sort of a supply demand imbalance where there hasn’t been enough in supply in the marketplace. . So it’s really going to be welcomed. . I think to some degree for you know the most highest quality Treasury securities in the marketplace. . From an MBA standpoint there may be a little bit more resistance but it’s smaller volume there as well. . Deborah got to leave it there. . Thank you. . Deborah Cunningham of Federated is going to leave it there because we’ve got some news from Bed Bath and Beyond. . Let me tell you this because some news is just headline after shock later this week to close 150 stores. . Jobs getting cut as well. . They say a reduction in the workforce a big reduction in the workforce. . Just gone through some of these numbers. . Yeah from what you say. . Well also discontinuing three of nine of their labels. . This comes after weeks of speculation around this company about them being able to raise finance saying they just filed a document earlier this morning saying that they would raise an unspecified amount of money in an unspecified amount of share sales at different times. . They didn’t really give any details to that. . But this really highlights a problem especially as some other suppliers cut off deliveries because they were worried about late payments. . These are some of the issues facing a company that’s been struggling for a while. . But how much can it rise above that especially since it wasn’t meme stock darling and had been able to raise money that way. . Let’s face it the big move this morning down about 25 per cent. . So second quarter comp sales declined about 26 percent. . They see full year comp sales down in the 20 percent range. . So that’s pretty tough going. . And on these chefs are you talking about promo to sell up to 12 million shares in an offering. . The offering proceeds to be used Tom to buyback John debt. . Is this a zombie company. . I say that with respect for the hardworking people in management and on the line at Bed Bath and Beyond Bed Bath and Beyond. . Total return per year for 20 years. . Negative 4 percent per year. . Total return the last 10 years. . Think of what they miss John versus other retailers. . Home Depot is the icon negative 14 percent per year. . If this does foot the fines zombie company why does an owner restructure our Milken transaction. . This feels like a kitchen sink type morning for the company Lisa that’s for sure. . Yeah especially because they’re trying to potentially raise money in the equity market to buy back shares. . That’s going to be terrible for the equity. . That’s why you’re seeing such a big response whether they’ll actually be able to do it. . They didn’t get to buy it. . Good question. . Dan. . Six percent in the free market and falling off the back of a ranger headlines will keep you up to speed on from New York City with Tom Keene Lisa Abramowicz and Jonathan Ferro. . We have about just about on the S&amp;P up two tenths on the Nasdaq 100 up a half of 1 percent. . This is Bloomberg. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world to the first word answers you could get to more revelations in the probe of those classified documents found at Donald Trump’s Florida home. . In a court filing the Justice Department suggests there may have been attempts to obstruct the investigation by moving some of the papers. . The filing included a photo of files labeled Top Secret said to have been found in the former president’s office. . The government was responding to his lawsuit to appoint a special master to review the documents. . Europe faces the risk of blackouts rationing and a severe recession if Russia slashes gas deliveries further. . And the next reality check is at hand. . Starting today there’ll be a halt in gas sent through the Nord Stream pipeline. . It’s a key source of energy for the EU. . There’s a concern that Moscow will find another excuse to clamp down on those supplies. . And prices in British shops rose this month at the highest rate since at least 2005 according to the British Retail Consortium. . Shop price inflation increased to five point one percent in August. . The price of food rose even more nine point three percent. . Shoppers are doing everything they can to save money at the checkout and that includes buying less food. . And Bloomberg has learned that Credit Suisse is board is divided on the fate of its troubled investment bank. . Just before crucial meetings one camp is pushing back against an aggressive downsizing. . Others are in favor of more extensive cuts after racking up billions of dollars in losses. . Credit Suisse is taking aim at the investment bank which has been at the heart of some of its biggest troubles globally is 24 hours a day on an all Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in Libya. . Hundred and twenty countries and rich. . Gupta This is Bloomberg. . At the European level we have agreed that all member states to do jointly save 15 percent of energy between August now and March 23. . And here’s the good news. . We have reached now an average in the European Union of Starch filling up 80 percent. . That is some good news. . That was from Ursula von Onto Land the European Commission president. . It’s good news because the original target was 80 percent. . By November 1st it’s the end of August. . So there you go. . Just a little bit of good news out there in Europe. . Life in New York City this morning. . Good morning. . With some keen and Lisa Abramowicz some Jonathan Ferro futures bouncing back kinda on the S&amp;P by not even two tenths of one percent on the Nasdaq 100 up 62 points up a half of 1 percent a year to higher by 2 or 3 basis points 313. . Not going to neglect this. . I think we have over the last 90 minutes or so. . But Cruden 88 handles we’re breaking down there by two point nine percent 88 95. . There were some concerns about supply out of Iraq. . I think Iraq has calmed down those concerns about supply out of Iraq. . And then on the horizon for the last I think 12 months at least. . This idea Lisa that maybe just maybe there is a deal from Iran. . But I feel like we’ve been talking about that forever. . This to me is a recession call. . It’s basically higher prices that are cannibalizing demand. . And the more that the NIKKEI event that the world slows down particularly led by China the less demand there will be. . And that’s what’s leading to lower prices. . That’s been sort of the theme over the past three months. . I’m with you. . Demand destruction some back on the table. . I think the jury’s out and I link it to the Covid policy of Asia. . The Chinese are Covid policy. . Maybe you get an Asia boom as some have written about some of the optimism Jay Polansky J.P. . Morgan and others on the Pacific Rim. . We got an oil update on your next gallon of gas. . Is Will Kennedy senior excuse me your next gallon of petrol. . Will Kennedy join senior executive editor commodities in London. . Well there’s a tone out there from a select few of a potential global disinflation. . For all the other matters out there is oil. . Is the Will Kennedy world linked to the possibility of a global disinflation or is oil separate. . I don’t think it’s set for it at all. . I think that the oil is being put under pressure by a lot of different things some of which John just mentioned geopolitical things. . But the thing that’s really putting under pressure the prospect of higher rates and a stronger dollar the stronger dollar has proved a huge headwind for oil and is one of the things that stopped it getting traction. . The other thing I want to say about the oil market is it remains hugely volatile. . We’re getting these big swings. . The Saudi oil minister intervened in the market last week to say to people look don’t write us off. . We’re willing to cut production if we need to. . That sent oil up as high as 106 for Brent. . We’re 10 dollars below that now. . And it’s interesting to me that piece and an took to Twitter this morning just to say that in its view the oil market is broken that these moves don’t make sense. . They’re not fundamentally driven. . They reflect a lack of liquidity in the market. . And it’s it’s quite hard to read oil from a fundamental perspective right now because a lot of people aren’t totally sure that the price signal whose the country you’re watching who’s the marginal player OPEC plus or minus the United States all the rest of it who’s the country that is the decider of oil dynamics into September. . I think there are four things we need to watch Tom sorry for the long answer. . China as you mentioned the huge driver of demand Russia. . We’ve got more sanctions coming on all at the end of the year. . What will that do to production. . Will they be able to sell more oil to Asia and less to Europe Saudi Arabia. . How do they respond to this market. . Do they follow through on the threat of cuts. . And finally the USA there are two things to watch in America. . Firstly we’re about to stop withdrawals from the SPRO which has been a huge source of comfort to the market. . Putting that oil into the market and Shell isn’t growing as fast as people expect. . It is a very interesting column from my friend having a blast this morning about how expensive pipe is getting in the shale patch and that’s that’s dampening growth. . So we’ve got to keep an eye on those four countries. . I think as we look to the market into the end of the year well we often probe this particular topic but let’s do it again. . Can you frame how difficult this winter is going to be and the decisions that some of these governments still haven’t made that they need to make in the next few weeks. . Well I think it’s instructive. . Just to give you some examples from the U.K. . actually where people are starting to realize just how catastrophic their bills are going to be. . And businesses in particular who are more exposed to free market prices than households in some respects. . We’re seeing all these stories of people running cafes pubs and they’re facing bills that are going up five times. . And frankly people are saying how can I operate my base my businesses on that basis. . And they’re saying without some form of government help I’m going to fold. . So I think you’re starting to get a picture about how this could really impact the wider economy. . And if these energy prices are left unchecked for small businesses for consumers in the U.K. . and other European countries it’s going to have catastrophic economic impact. . And I think what we’re watching is how governments respond in the U.K. . how the new prime minister we get next week responds because I think it’s going to need a big policy intervention. . Well there’s a plan and some plan to bring down the prices of electricity an emergency combating of the very high prices. . That’s what we learned from Ursula underlined this week when she gave a speech about what the European Commission is doing to collectively address the issue. . Do you understand what this plan is. . I think there are two parts to the plan. . I don’t think anyone fully understands it now. . They haven’t yet. . They haven’t sketched out the precise details. . But there are two perhaps two potential components one which may have an impact in the shorter term and one which is slightly longer term in the shorter term. . There’s some talk of a price cap and an attempt to cap the price of electricity which got completely out of hand. . Earlier this week crossing a thousand euros a megawatt hour in Germany unimaginable places previously. . Now that cap obviously would still require someone to pay the market price. . So actually what it is is a way of sharing the burden with the difference. . Go on government balance sheets. . Would it be shared between industry consumers and the state. . Somehow I think those details are yet to be worked out but clearly it would be an intervention that breaks the market mechanism for a period of time and shares the burden a bit differently. . Then there’s a second thing at the moment. . The price of electricity in Europe as in many markets around the world is set by the marginal cost of supply. . What the most expensive. . Unit a power you need to balance the market is and that’s traditionally that’s natural gas right now which is hugely expensive as you know. . Now the thinking is there’s a lot of power which is nuclear which is renewable which cost a lot less to produce. . So is there a way of linking power prices from natural gas prices perhaps by having some kind of price. . The average is the cost of production now. . This is complicated technical stuff. . It would have to be done in a way that the market still gets the signals it needs to balance the market. . Having that generation. . But that’s something that people are taking a serious look at. . But to be honest it would take a year maybe two years for that to happen. . It’s not a short term fix. . Well great to catch up sir. . And we’re looking forward to catching up again because we’re no expert on any of their. . So we need your expertise to break down just what’s going to happen. . We’ll kind of do that at a London policy intervention to try and tackle some of this stuff. . What are we talking about. . We’re talking about fiscal intervention now in a world of low rates QE and low inflation. . That might make sense in a world of high rates Kutty and high inflation. . Lisa I do wonder in certain countries how wide open the bond market is going to be for some of that and whether the adjustment we’re seeing in places like the UK is reflecting some of that angst at the moment. . Yeah I think that that’s a really good point. . And one of the most important conversations that I think we’ve had over the past few weeks is with Francisco Bianco of the paper presented at Jackson Hole talking about how fiscal stimulus gives the expectation for more inflation for a rescue to come in and that that really combats a lot of its central banks are trying to do a bigger deficit. . You’ve got to finesse in places like the United Kingdom. . That’s a topic we’ll continue to discuss with people like Dan Morris at BNP Paribas. . He’s going to be joining us shortly from New York. . Said he heard on radio seen on TV. . This is Bloomberg. . I don’t think it’s optimistic to suggest that the Fed will be able to navigate positive activity any time soon. . I think in the near term expect some choppy sessions. . There is a Fed call. . The says that any good news gets taken away by the Fed’s need to tighten the supply side is finally taking hold and creating the disinflation. . It’s really hard to see that we avoid a global recession. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . Good morning everyone. . Jonathan Ferro. . Lisa Abramowicz. . Tom Keene. . The last day of August the beginning of September the beginning of autumn. . Turmoil in the equity markets greater turmoil in the foreign exchange markets. . And John Lisa I just want you to understand natures first green as gold. . Her hardest hue to hold her early leaves of flower but only so an hour. . And on and on to nothing. . Gold can stay. . We quote Robert Frost. . Lisa. . Fall is upon us. . Yes it is. . You’re going to throw that word to me. . I was hoping that John would have to. . I’m picking up Leslie Caroline Connan. . We had to been in the break that I am actually excited for winter. . And John is not excited for winter. . And Tom you’re not. . John are the markets excited for winter. . And boy is this a turmoil time for the Fed. . I’ve said a few times to think winter arrived early in this market. . We’ve wiped out the gains for August. . And the last three days we’re down about 5 per cent on the S&amp;P 500. . Don’t fight the Fed seems to be the message. . And fighting the fat means being bullish right now. . That’s why so many people are finding it difficult to be bullish. . Yesterday we found that good news is bad news. . Consumer confidence decent job openings still elevated. . Apparently that’s bad news for this market because it means this Fed has more work to do at the moment is right now. . And it helped me with John. . And I fed the gentle lady from Cleveland who we saw at Jackson Hole out with more forward guidance data dependency and the rest. . And John it is a certitude among Fed officials that inflation will not pull back. . That seems to be the great tension race in Howard. . Race to warp. . Rameau they’re talking about a full handle halt for how long. . Williams was talking about maybe a year through the whole if 2023. . Yeah. . But also she’s saying that she sees unemployment above 4 percent by year end. . This is the dual mandate that becomes more difficult raising rates above 4 percent in early 2023. . The market still up. . Pricing that in right there getting up to three point nine percent if you look at the Fed funds futures market. . But you’re not seeing that forehand or the way that she’s putting out there. . And then there still is the expectation for rate cuts. . And Tom this is what’s striking to me. . People are still saying we don’t buy it. . You can keep saying whatever you want but we still think they’re going to be rate cuts at some point later in 2023 or at least early 2024 as you recapitulate and look at that unemployment rate that rises to store the run. . I mean we make a joke about it John but Lisa’s right. . The toxic brew that’s out there now is the desperation in September. . There’s few optimists out there. . So the economists will focus on what’s bad and what is good. . Markets have got to think about what’s better and what’s worse. . And somewhat I want to understand is how markets are gonna respond to this incoming information. . And we often think about this. . Okay. . That’s the data. . How’s the market responding to it. . Yesterday was an example where we got good economic news consumer confidence job openings and yet it was bad news for this market because this Fed has to do more. . I want to know going into Pete Rose on Friday when the bad news is good news or when the bad news is just bounce because ultimately the bad news in this labor market means payrolls are a little bit lower. . It means unemployment is a little bit higher. . It means wage growth starts to fade just a little bit too. . Add some. . That’s the objective of this Fed. . That’s the objective. . And the objective is going to be the news flow. . Let’s get to the new data. . I’m going to do a data point John. . ADP in 12 minutes ADP. . It’s 12 minutes. . What’s promo code. . An ADP Wednesday. . Hundred percent. . It’s not stickied features 1 percent. . The S&amp;P OCR by 3 basis points 313 44. . A lot of attention being paid to what’s happening in the affects market with the euro dollar at parity. . But for me and for Tim and Felicia very much about what’s happening with pants starting at the moment just breaking down to 116 some 160 up 26. . Watch it for an issue. . I agree with John. . Sterling is really quite interesting. . Maybe also looking idiosyncratic. . Turkish lira actually some stability this week. . Now a brief into September. . Daniel Morris joins us chief market strategist BNP Paribas. . Daniel how does your September change things. . What’s the nuance launching from August into the autumnal September. . Well I think at this point what’s not going to change is we’re going to have some hikes and we focus a lot on this. . Seventy 75 it’s going to be 50. . The payrolls data will inform that. . But we really should be focusing on the objective of the Fed which is to get growth down get inflation down. . And of course the interest rate hikes are just a means to an end. . So in one sense it’s a bit of a distraction. . It’s whatever it takes if you will to get growth down. . And not only growth per say but really to get the job market back into line with the recent JOLTS data with the job openings. . You know rose over the previous month. . And so you still have nearly eleven million job gap between what employers are looking for and what employees are left salable. . That means continued high wage gains. . That’s going to fuel inflation. . And that’s just not sustainable from the Fed’s point of view. . It’s not the environment that you want to be buying stocks in. . For now. . Yes. . So the real issue is going to be we all anticipate this recession next year. . That that is what it’s going to take to get inflation down. . But that doesn’t mean you should necessarily be allocating for that at this time. . So overall we’re still neutral on equities and have some markets that we favor. . But at some point yes you are going to want to pivot but we think it’s really premature at this point to be doing that. . And why is that. . Why do you think it’s premature. . Typically if you look at how markets react to recessions it’s really a one two at most three months prior to when the recession started that you start to see consistently negative returns for equities you know six months out 50/50 chance. . Now which of course different this time is how much we all anticipate this recession. . Whereas typically they often catch ISE investors by surprise. . So whether that time frame is going to be different this time will that pivot happen sooner. . More likely than not. . But I think we’re going to have to see more meaningful deceleration in the economy before that’s likely to happen. . Dan this is really at all about the economy or is this about the Fed. . I mean yes it’s the economy but the Fed wants to influence the economy lower. . And Neel Kashkari came out said he was happy to see the market sell off in response to the Jackson Hole speech by Fed Chair Jay Powell and that he was disappointed to see the rally in previous meetings because this was not the goal. . They wanted to see a tightening in financial conditions. . How much can you push against that with this sort of backward look to historical performance of equities in the face of recession. . Yeah absolutely. . And I think what we’re gonna have to anticipate of course on one hand we do have rates going up that’s increasing the discount rate. . So that should have a negative impact on valuations for equities. . We’re now really seeing the growth impact. . Yes. . You know we talk about earnings expectations still quite rosy for next year 10 percent earnings growth year on year. . And that’s just something that’s not compatible with the slowdown in growth that we think we’re going to have to see. . So it’s that tension. . You know what’s going to be the catalyst to bring those two back in line of course is the big question. . But we believe it’s going to happen at some point. . It has to do. . And what do you do with energy right now. . Well we are broadly speaking overweight commodities. . I mean on one hand in anticipation of a recession that typically is an environment for for lower oil prices because of lower demand which certainly will still happen. . But you know we’re in a different world when it comes to the supply side. . We’re not seeing that supply side response. . And we think the net effect of those two forces is for us still to be overweight commodities. . Dan I looked at the Bloomberg total return all in global aggregate index today and basically with a price decline yield up. . We’re back globally to where we were in 2011 stayed in the case for ownership of fixed income instruments. . I don’t get it. . Well you know you want to look at a film from a portfolio perspective. . I mean clearly the big disruption in the first half of this year was the change in the correlations the positive correlation between equities and bonds in a bad way with prices going down for both. . We appreciate we’re going through this transition of the 30 year bull market in fixed income to at least a bear market for a while. . But you know at 3 percent or a bit more for treasuries we’re getting to the point where we should have a stabilization of rates and that from a portfolio perspective. . It’s still going to make sense. . So right now timing we still anticipate higher rates were short duration but we don’t think we have anywhere as far to go as we did over the last six months. . Then just quickly just to get by on it how would you respond to a bank print on Friday. . It’s bad. . These bad news. . Bad news good news. . What is it. . It’s going to mean that the hike is 50 instead of 75. . It’s good news relative to the 75 but it’s still 50 and that’s what’s going to matter. . Morris of BNP Paribas Asset Management does this Dani Burger. . This is John what we’ve come down to try to figure out. . Good news good news bad news. . Wherever the four bucks prisoners Taylor Riggs. . And once you get a decent understanding of the reaction function of the Fed you apply that to the incoming information and it is not going on and try and work out what it means for this market. . Yesterday good news was bad news and the story. . I hate it some. . You hate it too. . I just wonder where the bad news is. . Also just bad news I think will be overcome by the facts and on watch and foreign exchange. . John all the different dynamics of 10 20 30 peers. . This is really important folks. . John knows this is not just follows repairs. . That’s not what the pros do. . They look at all sorts of dynamics there. . If I could follow one thing right now though it would be the U.K. . I think this is going to be a really interesting case study Tom. . You’ve got the energy crisis on the one hand and I think we can call it that. . I think it’s fair to characterize. . Yes. . As an energy crisis. . You’ve got the expectation that the government needs to offset that with fiscal policy. . And you’ve got a big question mark as to whether the bond market is going to be wide open available for them to do so. . And if it’s not then what do you say. . You see an adjustment. . Naturally they see you’ll see a weaker currency you’ll see higher yields. . What we’re seeing at the moment a weaker currency. . Right. . And higher yields. . It’s easy to make these kind of adjustments this offset if rates are low. . Yeah central banks keep them pinned there. . Inflation’s low. . And you doing QE. . Right now they’re set to do Kutty. . Inflation’s high and they’re raising interest rates. . Different dynamic in the prior era. . There is the option for fiscal support for fiscal spending because rates were so low because the window was so wide open for governments to borrow. . That is fluid flipped on its head. . What do you get if you have fiscal policy moving in the opposite direction for monetary policy. . If these two areas are in direct conflict with each other who wins out. . And ultimately what happens with inflation. . Sterling some just about 160. . Yeah the sterling is terrible John. . You know I look at Emily Bronte and she supported the talks years ago. . I love September fall leaves fall like this guy. . Flowers away clocks to lengthen and short. . So you know ahead we’ve got a break to take. . I mean I’d love to talk more about your trip but they got three of September as you fear. . It brings tears to my eyes. . Futures up a third of one per cent for goodness sake. . New York is pulling back. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word I’m sure you could go up to the Justice Department says White House records held in a storage room at Donald Trump’s Florida home may have been moved before an FBI search in June. . The Justice Department says that could have been an attempt to obstruct the investigation. . In a filing that was a photo of files labeled Top Secret said to have been found in the former president’s office. . The government was responding to his lawsuit to appoint a special master to review the documents. . Inflation in the eurozone has set a no all time high. . Consumer prices in the 19 country currency bloc rose nine point one percent in August from a year ago. . That beat the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. . And it strengthens the case for the European Central Bank to consider a jumbo interest rate hike when it meets next week. . Shares a bed Bath and Beyond are plunging today. . The struggling home goods retailer has secured new financing and will close stores and slash its workforce. . Bed Bath and Beyond faces a shrinking cash pile and is falling behind on payments to vendors. . That’s prompted some suppliers to halt or restrict shipments. . Shares of SNAP are falling today according to The Verge. . The parent of Snapchat plans to lay off about 20 percent of its nearly 60 500 employees starting today. . The stock already has fallen almost 80 percent this year. . Now it’s been struggling with a slowdown in advertising spending. . And Mikhail Gorbachev is being remembered as the last leader of the Soviet Union who ended the Cold War. . Gorbachev died Tuesday at a Moscow hospital. . His attempts to shake up the Soviet Union’s political and economic system led to the collapse of the communist superpower. . Gorbachev’s career disintegrated in the process. . He was 19 when global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts similar than 120 countries. . I’m Richard Gupta. . This is Glenn Beck. . Live from New York City this morning. . Good morning with some Cain and Lisa Abramowicz some Jonathan Ferro. . Do not shoot the messenger. . Downside surprise on the ADP. . And bad news is good news. . Equities up for 10. . So yes some say on the Nasdaq up eight tenths of 1 percent. . Would fade a little bit as well on a two year one off session highs almost unchanged on the session now up a basis points at 345. . 61 is the downside surprises 132. . We were looking for three inch. . Okay. . They sat on sweats at some from Ivan NIKKEI. . ADP unveils a new top spot maker. . That’s the latest ADP printed like that might be case with us. . Take one of mine. . Good morning John. . Yeah. . I’m the messenger but I don’t know what the message is here. . ADP says this is a brand new survey. . It’s been completely retooled. . It doesn’t depend on models. . It is a snapshot of the labor market during the month based on the payrolls that they process. . And as you said a hundred and thirty two thousand jobs 23000 are in the goods producing sector. . Although there was no change in manufacturing jobs and service providing jobs rise. . One hundred ten thousand. . Now what does this mean for Friday. . You listen to the ADP people. . It says nothing. . It’s a standalone indicator a unique snapshot of the economy. . But I bet everybody on Wall Right is going to be plugging these numbers into their forecasts for Friday which the consensus at this point is 300000. . They also Tom have a new report that is part of this report on pay. . And according to this annual pay a 12 month rate is was at seven point six percent rate of increase in the month of August which is high but they say stabilized. . Now hard to know exactly what stabilized is because we don’t have the black numbers. . But in theory they’re Ripley’s releasing those today. . They back casting and we’ll see what it all. . We’ll try to put it all together for you know a nice lift to the market here. . NASDAQ up 108 points. . That gets my attention. . Michael McKee moments words. . This has been a busted data point for umpteen years. . Mark Zandi tried to make it work and others after Mark Zandi did they went out and hired one of the best math guys in the world. . Erik Brynjolfsson With Andrew McAfee writing all sorts of things including the second Massie machine age. . What is Professor Brynjolfsson of Stanford going to do to make the second ADP age. . What’s he going to bring to this. . Well basically they’re looking at large sources of data that can be trimmed down to a smaller point that is useful to people. . They say this is not model based. . This is based only on the ADP data. . The Zandi versions will say they’re looking models the paychecks of America to get their data. . Yes. . In terms of in terms of small medium large establishments that they’re breaking it down by industry sector. . They’re even breaking down the pay stuff by the whether or not you’re a job leaver or a job stayer. . It sounds a lot like the Atlanta Fed wage tracker but we haven’t. . I mean it’s just come out. . So I have to share that. . This is the heart of the matter. . Lee says the maybe now they’re going to go to the actual data not to mean that the diary of data points of research points empire this. . I mean Lisa how many of these are these tertiary numbers empire. . This is Dallas manufacturing that these tertiary numbers are important for people who are completely data dependent because the Fed isn’t giving forward guidance supposedly. . Mike is this ADP report powerful enough to move the dial and be relevant going forward. . Is the new methodology enough of an overhaul to make it so that people don’t just shrug this off being like it’s ADP. . Well here’s the thing. . They retooled this because their model based previous surveys were designed to sort of preview what was going to happen in non-farm payrolls. . Now they say it’s not a preview. . You can’t extrapolate but probably people will try to do that. . And then it’ll depend on how close they come to the overall private sector job gains in the non-farm payrolls number. . So we’re going to have to see how how this all works out over the longer run. . I think Mike’s being kind to get a Mark Gurman and thank you for your leadership in Jackson Hole. . It was absolutely fantastic to see you with all the Fed precedents. . What’s the big takeaway for you Mike. . Because for many people it’s not September. . So 50 or 75 something bigger happening here. . Well it’s to be the terminal rate and how long it takes to get there and then how long they hold it. . The Fed is pretty much all of them are pretty much agreed that they’re going to get to a place above neutral and they’re going to hold rates there. . But there are disagreements about where that point is above neutral whether it’s three point five three point seventy five four percent or higher. . And there are disagreements about how long they may have to keep it there but they are determined to bring down inflation. . And I think that’s the message that J. . Paul on behalf of everybody was trying to send on Friday might. . Do you think they have sent a. . And a convincing way that higher unemployment is a price worth paying for lower inflation. . I’ve returned to that chairman power speech from Friday a couple of times now maybe four or five. . And I was reading through it yesterday and it was this word pain. . He talked about pain and I’ll share the quote with everyone. . While higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation. . They will also bring some pain to households and businesses. . But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain. . Mike how convinced you think the general public are of that. . I don’t know because I don’t know how much attention the general public pay to the Fed but through the markets the markets seem to be buying into it but slowly through the markets. . People will see the impact and maybe it starts to register. . Powell did not say we’re going into recession. . He didn’t say unemployment is going to rise. . You have to read between the lines which everybody on Wall Street can do. . And I don’t know how many. . The general public are actually paying that much attention especially in August when their focus is on that last vacation before school. . Stay with the leaves changing as well. . Mike let me cut to the chase very quickly. . Here at home. . He’s talking 4 percent. . Inflation is where we’re heading. . What’s the quote. . There’s John mentions. . What’s the pain in a 4 percent inflation. . Well we’ve heard the Fed suggest that we get to a four point one percent unemployment rate which would mean a minimum amount of pain because the Fed believes that the natural rate of unemployment is for an apposite. . So it’s hard to say you get to 4 percent unemployment or 4 percent inflation and maybe people start to feel a lot better. . But look at what happened with the consumer confidence numbers yesterday because gas prices have fallen. . They’re still really high but they’ve fallen. . So people are feeling better. . Mike thank you sir. . NIKKEI in the seats. . Go through the ADP print side. . Surprise ahead of payroll some Friday looking for something in and around 300. . Okay. . It’s pretty conventional wisdom in economics Tom but pretty controversial when the general public starts to hear this message that higher unemployment is a price worth paying. . Oh I don’t think I John I feel the public doesn’t buy it for one single sentence. . The second they’re looking at these people going. . Are you nuts. . That’s why Tom I think it becomes much more controversial when we actually start to see these numbers. . And I go back to the comments from Senator Warren over the weekend to CNN. . She’s not going to be alone if unemployment starts to go down. . And Rand every single news conference is saying is part of the plan. . I mean I haven’t seen anything. . John help me with the United Kingdom or Lisa what you’ve read as well. . What’s the food cash kitchen. . So I mean we’re making jokes. . I’m making jokes about autumnal bliss. . Baloney. . It’s getting colder. . For a growing homeless population. . Electricity prices and utility bills makes it top of mind for everybody in Europe right now. . Yeah very much a very big concern. . But just going back to this idea of the labor market and the pain there there is this issue of the JOLTS survey of the job openings. . And this is sort of the soft landing scenario that if you take away some of the job openings you won’t necessarily get layoffs. . You’ll just sort of get this nirvana soft landing. . That is a beautiful thing. . It is. . That’s the case. . We all hope it’s the case. . I hope that’s the case. . Futures up a third of one percent. . I know Mike when I said I’m no allusion to September but he. . Sure you took him. . He was up a company. . I was just bullish by the way. . He said that he won the tone wasn’t bullish. . I was kind of like a. . For about a second five minutes ago Lisa was almost bullish except she said bullish thing that went to like it was a fairy tale matter said Lisa tone matters. . You clicked as this is how it’s something that was bullish. . That was foolish. . But if you make it sound like a fairy tale once upon a time job openings came down and unemployment didn’t rise. . It is a fairy tale. . Didn’t have to go that high and growth stabilized. . And if one was happy and it was a big bull market. . OK so you’re quoting fairy tales. . Sleep well. . Hum is putting Robert Frost happy. . No idea what his clients want to say. . How much movement from grandma gloom time to Primo Standard Time on the NASDAQ 7 cents of one per cent. . Yo tapas a couple of basis points 312 31. . If you can grab Pat Sterling just like me eurodollar with the break. . Apparently at ninety nine Nani wants Sterling 116 and just about holding on as well. . That currency pairs down four tenths of one percent earlier on this morning. . I mentioned the comments from Charlie Bean to our team over in London. . The X Bank of the deputy governor who talked about a risk premium that might have to return to the gilt market because of the ongoing deficit that we’re seeing in the UK and the fact that it could get bigger because they need to offset the pain in the utility market. . The energy market and Stephen Engle most picking up on this. . And he’s basically saying we think it’s also showing up in the currency. . Now tell me if you worry about finance to get deficit as you know you even need to attract investors with high yield. . So a weaker currency to get those international flows and arguably be getting both right now. . It’s a difficult moment for the policymaker. . It’s a very very different backdrop this time around to the fiscal oversupplied. . Back in spring of 2020 it’s always a trilateral or three pronged or three legged stool John. . And I’m in the camp. . That foreign exchange really matters right now. . And when you were biased at Bloomberg on that because it’s just so supple on the terminal. . But John I’m sorry it’s speaking volumes. . And what really interests me is Swiss Re has not strengthened. . This is not a fear thing. . It’s not a Ukraine thing. . This is an economic growth thing. . And that’s why you see UK historically John even as we do this section with the lease we may get a 115 ambulance. . It’s a policy thing time and policy. . And a lot of countries at the moment is in conflict with each other on fiscal monetary. . We’re just about holding onto what’s 16 right now some on Pat Sterling against the US dollar to the labor economy of a beleaguered United Kingdom and certainly moving to jobs day on Friday. . We begin and we thought we’d do something different this time not with what’s non-farm payrolls going to be but far more of the social aspects of our labor economy. . The Economic Policy Institute granted left leaning Democrat Biden favored whatever you want to say. . They have provided exquisite must read research for conservatives on the social structure of the American labor economy. . Elise Gould joins us this morning. . Elise I’m going to channel the good David Blanchflower up at Dartmouth College and he is heated. . We’ve got it wrong that it is a heterogenous labor economy. . And I’m going to use from John Edwards two three or four Americas. . What percentage of America is flat on its back. . That’s it. . Very interesting question. . I think that you’re right that there are different stories of what is happening to people when you think about the economy we think about the labor market overall. . The unemployment rate has remained at three point five percent. . That’s quite low. . We still are adding jobs every month that are pulling more people back into the labor market. . But as you say I think there are huge disparities still out there. . Young workers still have much higher unemployment rates than other workers. . Black workers still have about two times the unemployment rate of white workers. . We still have seen wage growth in areas like leisure and hospitality had been stronger. . Last year is now coming down. . All right. . That is decelerating. . So I think that there are different stories. . And those wages in some of those industries. . But most men have turned. . Those are still quite right. . At least we’re spending a lot of time on the x axis looking at the duration of these events. . There is a negative wage growth. . The real wage is decidedly negative. . But importantly the duration of that negative almost a hysteresis of that negative wage growth is substantial. . What’s the tipping point where that negative wage growth really affects society in America. . Well I think it is hitting many people right now. . Already they’re noticing it when they go to the grocery store. . They’re noticing it obviously when they buy gas. . Though we are seeing those energy prices come down. . And I think that will trickle that will filter into lower prices overall because transportation costs are a major factor in many of the costs. . I think it will become more affordable. . I am somewhat optimistic as you all were talking about before. . I think there there is the ability to see that kind of optimism even though nominal wage growth is starting to slow a bit. . I think that that rate of growth is starting to slow. . I think that we will see gains in the future in terms of living standards as inflation comes down late. . Lisa I want to go to the point we were discussing earlier about how much fiscal policymakers hands are tied when it comes to supporting the market when the economy does start to decline. . Right. . There is this feeling that they will have to slow materially possibly go into a recession and that fiscal policymakers cannot spend to the same degree that they have in the past for fear of only fueling some of this inflation fueling what the Fed has to do and creating an even bigger downturn. . Do you think that that is the appropriate way to look at this. . That there cannot be fiscal spending in the same kind of way. . Period. . Full stop for years to come. . Well I don’t know. . I mean I think we need to make the kind of investments that are necessary to do things like pull down inflation pull down energy prices the long run. . I think that’s what we’re seeing in the Inflation Reduction Act. . I think that we’re going to see that in the future. . I think that those investments are actually important. . I also think about the kind of investments we need to make to increase the supply of workers. . So make sure that we have as many workers out there as possible. . And that will also help with the economic growth in the future. . So doing things like making investments and care work those kinds of things will allow more women to enter the labor force. . In fact if you if you have more people workers entering the labor force then that will put less pressure on wages. . And so I can see there being different parts of this but I don’t actually think we need to have a substantial slowdown as we’re already seeing inflation begin to fall. . Well I guess I’m I’m just questioning certain aspects of this both the U.S. . and internationally. . When you start to talk about spending to support especially lower income individuals who are really struggling how much there will still be an open market for raising cash for those things. . Right. . The U.S. . perhaps not as serious of a condition as United Kingdom in this capacity but the student loan relief measures like this do you think that that is a net benefit even at a time when it could on the peripheries add to inflationary pressure. . I think all the evidence suggests that that is a very tiny impact on any kind of inflation. . So I don’t think that is a major factor in thinking about whether or not something is a good policy. . I think we can look at other things about who is going to be affected by the policy how well how well it’s going to be targeted how well it’s going to impact people’s ability to make ends meet all of those other things. . I think the impact that research shows that the impact on inflation is pretty negligible. . One final question if I could. . There is a gross assumption that businesses and corporations out of the great financial crisis took the high ground in power over labor. . There is now an assumption perhaps that labor is gaining strengths coming out of this pandemic. . Do you buy it. . I do. . Actually I think that we’re seeing it in activity in terms of increased interest in unionisation. . We saw that recently with a Gallup survey about you know growing numbers of people interested in collective bargaining. . You’re seeing those activities across the country. . I think that will have some staying. . I think that we will see that may translate into a bit more leverage moving forwards. . Lisa Scott thank you. . If the Economic Policy Institute on the labor market in America important week for the labor market in America. . The ADP report out about 15 minutes ago. . Call it 20 minutes ago now. . Downside surprise 132. . The estimate is 3 inch. . Okay is up for Friday 300 K is the estimate down 5 28 in the previous month. . The WHO was hired was his job to 85 in a couple days ago. . Shery Ahn really has been climbing some show but I I have so much trouble John with the gloom of a 300 or 285 number versus the normal time say 200000 or 225. . I get that somebody it’s a plant or data point right. . So since you start getting concerned about that the horse has bolted and you go with that data. . And John you know stay with me September 1 when the leaves begin to change. . Unit labor costs frankly is just as powerful as jobs day. . It’s going to show us you know that wage dynamic that inflation is the most important data points I’m looking out is going to be the unemployment rate. . It’s at three point five percent is expected to stay there on Friday. . I keep saying this because I think it is going to be one of the most important stories in the next 12 months. . The Fed is telling us later that unemployment is going to climb. . I’m not quite sure we fully got our hands around. . Well that’s going to look like when it happens. . All right. . A master saying she is expecting the unemployment rate to climb to 4 percent. . The argument the others make is that there still is so much room for people to come back. . The labor market the participation rate could go up the productivity rate could go up that it could create the soft landing that Elise Gould was talking about. . But what happens if it doesn’t happen. . And must many people say that it’s much more likely that we don’t get that kind of Goldilocks scenario. . You know my bullish than Lisa. . I’m being I’m trying to be actually fair. . These are the arguments that people are made balanced. . Balanced. . Yeah. . Not just you know with skeptical. . I’m not sure what Tom’s up to. . All right. . It’s Tom. . Yeah. . You know it’s a loaded question. . I’m getting ready for the talks. . I can’t focus. . John I just did a survey for you to get you up to Vermont for the leaves of October. . They’re sold out. . Woodstock. . Yes. . That’s not Vermont. . That’s just what sold out. . Just sold ISE completely. . Yeah that’s good things off. . All right. . No place to stay John. . All right. . They’re sold out the hotels. . Yes. . OK. . No no it’s not a hotel. . It’s one of America’s most famous since John Coulter. . Seriously. . Woodstock Vermont was redone by John Rockefeller decades and decades ago. . He was the first one to put the power lines below the street. . So you drive into this town and it looks like a Dickens novel. . I’m just picturing right now. . ISE going on an apple picking trip. . Oh Tom we’ll be reading Robert Frost. . Yes. . John kind of going to Wikipedia Wikipedia to tell us everything about that particular plot of land in Vermont. . OK. . We actually pick an apple. . You’ll be evaluating which apples are the Jihye Lee. . Why. . That we can make quick insider reading Wikipedia. . Tell us all about it. . I’m not going. . No. . No. . Hey come on. . A rowboat. . We can go up to Stowe Vermont. . John Tucker. . No no no. . I’m not going. . Senator Leahy could show the Yankees owner is put a minority stake in my football club some AC Milan. . That’s just happened to power. . Really. . We’re expecting that to happen. . That’s news you can use. . OK. . We’d actually like to win something nice. . Features futures up at that from New York. .

There’s a concern that Moscow will find another excuse to clamp down on supplies. . Meanwhile oil is headed for its third monthly drop in a row. . That’s the longest losing streak in more than two years. . West Texas Intermediate has lost more than 6 percent this month. . Economists see slower global growth which would further hurt demand for oil. . And Bloomberg has learned that Credit Suisse’s board is divided on the fate of its troubled investment bank. . Just before some crucial meetings one camp is pushing back against an aggressive downsizing. . Others are in favor of more extensive cuts after racking up billions of dollars in losses. . Credit Suisse is taking aim at the investment bank which has been at the heart of some of its biggest troubles. . And the U.S. Army has grounded its entire fleet of about 400 CHF 47 Chinook transport helicopters. . That’s after engine fires broke out on a few of them. .

This is an extremely important conversation for all wired up to crypto like me. . And at least so Mr. . Rubenstein joins us this morning. . Look for that 9:00 p.m. . tonight. . This guy’s controversial to say the least. . What is his crud. . What is the the thing that he has that makes people in crypto. . Listen to him. . Well he’s very smart. . He’s made a lot of money when you make a lot of money lost a lot of money to David. . But at the age of 30 he was worth 22 billion dollars. . He became the youngest person to sign the giving pledge. . And he’s committed to giving away all his money. . He basically spends nothing on himself. . He lives in the Bahamas basically has no clothes of any consequence. . He wears shorts and T-shirts and tennis shoes all the time lives in a dorm with eight friends or so. . He only cares about certain public issues and public policy. . But he’s very unusual. . How does he control or what does he believe the price of bitcoin will do. . How does it discover a bid at whatever level. . Well I didn’t ask him that because he’s basically he operates FTSE CAC which is an exchange. . So it gives everybody the opportunity to buy or sell Bitcoin or other crypto currencies. . He doesn’t know what the right price should be. . He recently bailed out a lot of U.S. . companies that had troubles. . He might lose money on all that but he feels it was good for the industry. . So why is this industry important from a social benefit kind of way. . If he is David incredibly idealistic and looking for the betterment of social order. . Well his view is that people who have money should give away that money or do things for good social purposes. . And that’s what he’s always believed then. . He now has a fair amount of money and he’s giving away a good deal money. . He’s also involved in politics and he gives a lot of money to politicians. . He thinks it’s good to get good public servants in government. . And so he’s trying to back the ones he thinks are good. . He has unusual lifestyle in that he’s really not buying any of the accoutrements of wealth that you normally get when you have a multibillion dollar fortune. . I have to pivot a little bit because David Rubenstein I caught an article that was written about you a couple of days ago about his potential bid for the Nationals possibly the Orioles should they come up for free. . Is this random a moment of passion or is this something that’s actually an investment at a time when a lot of people are looking for alternative assets. . Well you know I I realized when I was young I wasn’t going to be a professional baseball player. . I thought I was a great star at six or seven. . But when I got the eight or nine I realized I probably wasn’t going to make the major leagues. . So I figured if I ever get to the major leagues I probably have to do it as an investor or an owner. . So I have I am from Baltimore. . I have looked at whether buying a baseball team makes some sense but that’s too early to say what’s going to happen now. . I Lisa that was a very dangerous question. . Why is it dangerous. . David Westin is dangerous quite ever come back again to the point of baseball. . In sports the stereotype of big hitters is that can buy any sports team and it never goes down. . It just always goes up. . Why is that. . It’s hard to lose money on a sports team generally when you own them. . The NFL teams they make money hand over fist. . Baseball basketball other teams. . They make money when you tend to sell the team. . And so people rarely lose money selling a team. . In the end if you you can support the team without current income from a team you can do quite well just holding it for quite some time. . But if you look at most people who’ve made money in baseball it’s by selling the team not operating at daily. . On the other hand some teams are very profitable and cash flow basis. . Where are you and Carlyle with investments over the years on public investment and stadium. . Now you don’t need to do that in Baltimore because Camden Yards is truly one of our jewels. . But but should public funds be spent. . I’m trying to think of the city right now where this is a raging debate. . Should we buy new baseball stadiums. . Well every every government official presumably is elected by people and they make the decisions that hopefully reflect what their population wants. . Our populations tend to want these things. . People like our sports teams. . You have such an enduring place in philanthropy. . If Mr Sam Brinkman freed enjoys going from 22 billion down to 8 billion and let’s say Bitcoin cracks and goes down to whatever 12000 whatever does he change. . I don’t think he changes a lot. . He’s a member. . He’s not spending this on his personal kind of needs. . He’s not buying homes or planes or things like that. . And I think whether he’s worth 8 billion 22 billion or 1 billion I don’t think he’s going to change very much. . He’s very young. . He’s only 30 years old. . I’d like you to come back and talk to me for one hour about the National Archives which is being dragged through the mud right now. . I know this is a third rail for you. . And if you find the time and the energy I would love to do a half hour nonstop on what is anytime heart and soul. . The National Archives is a great institution in Washington and has all of the records of our federal government. . And it’s been around from the 1920s that they don’t have a current head because David Farrell resigned retired. . But there will be somebody who is likely to be confirmed soon. . The first woman to be the chief archivist United States. . He’s talked right around me there. . What if the right wing part of America goes after your national archives with your philanthropy on Magna Carta and the rest. . Well there are people in Congress who I think we’ll prevent that from how the system will prevent it. . I hope so. . All right David thank you so much. . David Rubenstein we know tonight with RTX CEO Sam Beckman Friedan’s Lisa Abraham. . What’s said to me in my ear. . Orioles three games behind in the wildcard race as well. . Thank you for that information. . Keep throwing me under the bus. . Yeah basically just trying to make me look like badge words tomorrow. . Team Dow Jones is at least. . Lisa what are you looking at in there. . Take care. . I think I’m watching. . See whether we get a little bit more of the gains particular with the NASDAQ. . I find this the most interesting that people are going back and buying big tech on this belief that the economy will slow that rates will get lower that inflation expectations are coming down and pile back into big tech. . It’s just it is a tenuous tape. . It is a new gene to use your word because people don’t have conviction ahead of the labor market before. . Hey I learned today that it’s August. . So yeah it’s very it’s going to be it’s going to be really really interesting. . Here we go to Jobs Day folks. . But also there’s a whisper here of the effect of disinflation. . That’s really not in the published literature right now. . I think we’re going to see that with a vengeance here into September as well. . On balance of power today on Bloomberg Television and Bloomberg Radio. . She has my Book of the Year. .

            "title": "[Finance English] Powell's Jackson Hole Speech (2022.08.26)",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. . Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. . At past jackson hole conferences, I have discussed broad topics such as the ever-changing structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetory policy under high uncertainty. . Today, my remarks will be shorter and my focus narrower and my message more direct. . The federal open market committee’s overarching focus right now is to bring inflation back down to the 2% goal. . Price stability is the responsibility of the federal reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. . Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. . In particular, Without price stability, We will not achieve sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. . The burden of high inflation falls heaviest on those least able to bear them. . Restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance. . Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth. . Moreover, There will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. . While higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation. . They will also bring some pain to households and businesses. . These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. . But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain. . The U.S. economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of since 2021 which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession. . While the latest economic data has been mixed, In my view, economy continues to show strong underlying momentum. . The labor market is particularly strong but it is clearly out of balance with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. . Inflation is running well above 2% and high inflation has continued to spread through the economy. . While the lower inflation readings for July are certainly welcome, a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see, before we are confident that inflation is moving down. . So we are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2%. . At our most recent meeting in July, The FOMC raised the target range for the the federal funds rate to two and a quarter to two and a half percent which is in the summary of economic projections range of estimates of where the federal funds rate is projected to settle in the longer run. . In current circumstances with inflation running far above 2% and the labor marekt extremely tight estimates of longer run neutral are not a place to pause or stop. . July’s increase in the target range was the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings and I said then that another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting. . We are now about halfway through the intermediate period, Our decision at the september meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook. . At some point, As the stance of monetary policy tightens further, It likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. . Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. . The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. . Committee participants most recent individual projections from the June Sep showed the median federal funds rate running slightly below four percent through the end of 2023. . Participants will update their projections at the September meeting. . Our monetary policy deliberations and decisions build on what we’ve learned about inflation dynamics both from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and 1980s and from the low and stable inflation of the last quarter century. . And, In particular, We are drawing on three important lessons that I will highlight. . The first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation. . It may seem strange now that central bankers and others once needed convincing on these two fronts, But, As former chairman Ben Bernanke has shown both propositions were widely questioned during the great inflation period. . Today, We regard these questions as settled our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional. . It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the united states. . It’s also true in my view that the current high inflation in the united states is the product of strong demand and constrained supply and that the FED’s tools work principally on aggregate demand. . None of this diminishes the federal reserve’s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability. . There is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply we are committed to doing that job. . The second lesson is that the public’s expectations about future inflation can play an important role in setting the path of inflation over time. . Today, By many measures, Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, That is broadly true of surveys of households businesses and forecasters and of market-based measures as well. . But that is not grounds for complacency with inflation having run well above our goal for some time. . If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, Then absent major shocks, It likely will unfortunately the same is true of expectations of high and volatile inflation. . During the 1970s, the anticipation became entrenched in the economic decision-making of businesses and households. . The more inflation rose, The more people expected it to remain high and they built this into price decisions. . During the 1970s, As inflation climbed, The anticipation of high inflation became entrenched in the economic decision-making of businesses and households. . The more inflation rose, The more people came to expect it to remain high and they built that belief into wage and price decisions. . As former chairman Paul Volcker put it at the height of the great inflation in 1979, Inflation feeds in part on itself so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations. . One useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of rational inattention. . When inflation is persistently high, Households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate inflation into their economic decisions. . When inflation is low and stable, They are freer to focus their attention elsewhere. . Former chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way. . For all, Practical purposes price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions. . Of course, Inflation has just about everyone’s attention right now which highlights a particular risk today. . The longer the current bout of high inflation continues the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. . And that brings me to the third lesson which is that we must keep at it until the job is done. . History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay. . As high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price, Setting successful volcker disinflation of the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years. . A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem high inflation and to start the process of again getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. . Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now, So these lessons are guiding us as we use our tools to bring inflation down. . We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that come it comes into better alignment with supply and to keep inflation expectations anchored. . We will keep at it, Until We’re confident the job is done. . Thank you. .",

            "title": "[Finance English] Oil at $100 | Bloomberg Surveillance (2022.08.12)",
            "content": "Oil at $100 . I don’t know how long it’ll take to come down but clearly the momentum is down on inflation. . Yes they are coming down but I think are very far away from the Fed’s objective. . We look at other measures of inflation. . There’s still a lot of work for the Fed to do with the economy slowing and inflation is coming down after they want to be sure they are on the right track. . I think the Fed looks at this has been as the beginning of of their battle and having been more credible but having more work to do. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . Good morning everyone. . Jonathan Ferro. . Lisa Abramowicz. . Tom Keene. . Thank you for being with us on a Friday. . On radio. . On television Lisa. . There it is again. . One hundred dollars a barrel on Brent crude. . And this comes after mixed reports yesterday. . This to me I find that yes he had the IAEA coming out and saying they actually expect increased demand for oil. . And then you had OPEC coming out and saying that they expect a surplus. . The market has voted with the IEA. . They are not necessarily taking the OPEC view on its face. . Commerzbank I thought did a great job out of Frankfurt on this on this mixed nature that Lisa talks about. . Stephen Schork joining us here I believe it was yesterday. . Lisa he says Henry Hub in New York surges was the word to use. . Yeah. . And he partly though he sees this weakening in demand. . This is the big debate. . Is this signal or is this noise. . Is this signaling something that is negative in the economy that goes beyond just the technicals of oil. . And that is not only what what Stephen Schork said but also Mandy’s. . You have Credit Suisse coming out and saying she views this as a symptom of the slowing demand of the decline that you’re seeing in our mental good economy. . And while it might be spinning but this is the demand side of the equation that’s weakening that so many people have been betting on. . I was a raging debate today and clearly I love with Thomas Vargas says over Peavy Yemen are right up on nat gas. . It’s simple. . Oil is attached to the surge that we see in equities reaffirmed this morning. . And what a surge in has been Tom I mean the Nasdaq 100 an index full of big tech stocks that have performed really badly in the first half and seen this remarkable renaissance. . It’s up four weeks in a row potentially if it closes out the week in positive territory. . That’s the longest winning streak going back to November of last year. . Tom equity markets rallying at a time that the Fed would like to see financial conditions tightening not loosening. . Where does that leave us. . Lisa one final question. . Before the data and it’s simple is the bond market is confused as the oil microeconomic market while the bond market is following the same logic that the oil market perhaps is following if you view it from the demand side. . If you view it from this cooling inflation story. . Right. . Basically you saw the biggest inflow into investment grade credit going back to September of 2021. . In this past week people are flooding back to bonds. . They’re flooding back to equities. . This is a disinflationary story. . This is a Fed that’s moving away from the hawkish tilt story. . And this is a feeling that we can achieve soft landing. . It’s an interesting Friday. . We’re going to give you a reprisal here for three hours or more with good guess. . We’re going to get to Ron Temple in our own here. . But all I can say is really an extraordinary Friday to stagger on to Jackson Hole really beginning to prepare our coverage of Jackson Hole. . Some wonderful guests scheduled to be with us. . Their futures up 21 Dow futures up 150. . We’re not quite back on a futures basis to where we were with the enthusiasms of yesterday but nevertheless a lift. . The VIX shows it with a 20 level twenty point zero eight in the bond space. . I don’t know what to say. . Yields are all over the place three point to 1 percent and the 2 year yield curve inversion less inverted than before the CPI report. . We’ve moved from negative 49 basis points to negative 33 basis points a dollar churning here and I guess with Euro 1 0 2 ninety six really showing the definition of churning I should note Sterling 121 42. . Some huge challenges in Britain and France on wildfires and on drought. . There’s never a drought in the brief. . The brief is always rich with information. . On a Friday she’s awake. . Rameau I am awake. . And I want to say yesterday we talked about that ten year auction and it was actually really dramatic and it was part of the pivot yesterday in markets with yields higher and stocks lower. . We will get to that later in the show. . 10 AM watching University of Michigan sentiment survey. . Yes we’re watching the headline number which perhaps could rebound just a touch from what has been an incredible march downward. . How much is this really being driven by oil prices and how much do you see that reflected in the five to 10 year forecast of inflation that they put out as part of this survey. . I know if John Farrow were here Tom Keene would come out and say how many people do they survey. . Why have I never been surveyed. . And we’d question whether this is just a signal or whether this is something to really hinge on. . 12:00 p.m. . USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Report. . This will be fascinating at a time when we just saw food prices surge the most going back to 1979. . That to me was one of the biggest. . Aways from the CPI report. . What are the supplies going to look like and this goes to the weather disruptions that we’ve seen over in Europe but also in the United States. . It has been really dry. . How much does that really crimp production of wheat of soybeans of corn. . And then on Sunday Saudi Aramco is going to be reporting earnings. . The expectation could be that perhaps it will double its profits in the wake of what we’re seeing in oil prices. . Tom what do we get in terms of an issue with respect to the supply the oversupply that OPEC is talking about. . They could see a potential surplus. . Do we see that in the earnings. . We see that in the guidance from Saudi Aramco with oil. . But also it’s going to move over to NASDAQ natural gas which avoid said mislabeled as just simply should be called methane which is really what it is Lisa. . And natural gas is front and center. . Huge amount of noise out of the war in Ukraine when TGIF in Netherlands is doing. . But the U.S. . surge in energy one is just really a shock. . And it comes also as we deal with the heat wave that we’re seeing across America. . And we’re also trying to export some to Europe. . A real confluence of events toxic brew the toxic brew made in Kailey Leinz is not used to. . When we talk about toxic brew the 5:00 a.m. . hour is toxic brew free. . Ron Temple makes us smarter this morning. . Go ahead. . A multifaceted head with Lazard Asset Management. . And Ron I want to cut right to the equity paragraph and you’re always crystal clear note which is you are focused on the grand conundrum into next year which is measuring the persistency of cash flow the persistency of free cash flow. . How do you actually do that. . Well this is all about doing the bottom up fundamental analysis Tom I’m sure you’re familiar with that mean looking out and trying to understand what makes a company generate high returns on capital and what are the drivers of whether that return on capital can stay high or whether it declines. . And so we’re really focused here in terms of you know what I’m looking at in the equity market is trying to avoid the speculative growth stocks that are all about earnings that might come down the pike say 5 7 10 years where all of the value of the companies in that terminal value. . And it’s much more vulnerable to higher discount rates and avoiding the deep value cyclical stocks that are most at risk if you have a recession and sticking right in the middle of that kind of continuum on the quality stocks the companies with high returns on capital that are pricing power brand advantages strong management strong balance sheets and that’s where you really want to do the work to understand what makes a company so strong and how they can maintain that position over time. . Robert we’ve heard this before from other people who are trying to gird for a recession but it feels like the mood shifted this week. . Have you shifted anything about your thesis in the heels of the CPI report and PPA and even what we’re seeing in terms of Fed funds teachers. . I think the market is reacting to the positive sign that we’ve probably seen the peak in inflation. . We’ve finally seen inflation roll over and it’s more of those cyclical items. . The items that we all thought were transitory about a year ago that are rolling over. . If you look at the decline and CPI that we saw this week from last month from June to July 25 basis points of the 40 basis point deceleration was cars and airfare. . So those are factors that we knew would roll over at some point. . What I’m really watching is rent of shelter. . What I’m watching is wage growth. . And so I think investors should be careful because you know as I listen to you for the last few minutes I think there is a propensity in the market to say OK this story’s over. . We’re gonna go back to the old playbook. . The Fed won’t have to raise rates as much. . And I can buy these companies that are growth the kind of call options. . I don’t think that’s the right call. . I think we’re in the midst of a paradigm shift on inflation. . And when inflation does settle I think it’s going to settle with a three handle not a one and a half to two percent like we saw for the decade into 20 19. . So I would be a little a lot more careful than I think I’m seeing in the markets of kind of overreacting to data in the short term. . Okay. . So Ron if you’re more careful does that mean you still view what we’ve seen as more of a bear market rally than a bonafide sustainable rally. . I do still believe it’s a bear market rally. . Man I could always be proven wrong. . We always have that risk. . But when I look at us I think we need to wait for data next month. . I expect CPI to come down again. . I’m very interested to see the job numbers. . There’s there are mixed signals in the job market. . We had a great payroll number last Friday. . But if you look at the JOLTS state of the job opening labor turnover survey we’ve seen a million jobs decrease in the number of unfilled positions in the last two months. . Now again that data is a month lagged relative to payroll data. . But what I want to see is are those unfilled jobs going away. . Which then means labor has less negotiating power which then means you’re less likely to see wage growth which is less likely than to pass through to prices going up for goods and services. . So so I think we need to watch more data. . But right now I think this is a bear market rally as a base case assumption. . And again I would be careful of running back to the playbook that worked for the last 10 15 years because I think that playbook should probably be thrown out around the temple if we throw out quality large cap stocks which is the mantra right now wrong and read about it five times this weekend. . What is the new mantra going to be. . Well to be careful I think quality is the playbook you want. . I think the playbook for the last 10 15 years that worked was by the call option by the company. . That is a really cool business plan that’s getting access to capital at zero interest rates unlimited capital with our gear. . I think that’s going to be much tougher. . So it’s that end of the spectrum I think is more at risk. . I think quality. . It’s interesting Don there’s been a Venn diagram overlap right. . Where a lot of the quality and the growth where the same company. . I still like the quality growth companies. . They know there’s companies that can generate high cash flow and grow. . Well that’s great if they’re at the right valuation. . Ronald Temple thing. . The good news is by the way the valuations have come down. . So thank you. . Well they have. . Ronald Temple thank you so much for starting us off. . Strong Lazard Asset manager at least I think it’s a conundrum. . And into the weekend I’m fascinated to see what the different shops do with their equity calls and particularly how what I’m going to call the gloom crew Fortress Bramwell. . I’m really pleased to see the team Lisa. . Yes it’s a lot like how they do a nuance here. . Like do they take us VIX up 100 points. . I mean I don’t know. . What they do given is Mr. . Temple says a bear market rally. . Well manage you of Credit Suisse yesterday was on Bloomberg Television and she was saying she is not on my property. . She’s got she’s she’s a gloom she’s a gloom crew member. . And she does see stocks going down. . But she says that this rally could continue because of oil prices weakening. . Right. . And because that’s really been the fuel for so out of this. . So to speak. . I’m sorry. . Ninety nine. . Ninety five. . I’m Brent crude is not weakening. . Oil price went as a kid. . You were pumping 44 cents a gallon. . Gas Brent crude at one hundred dollars. . Stay where this this is Bloomberg. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word answers can get better. . FBI agents reportedly searched Donald Trump’s Florida home for classified documents related to nuclear weapons. . That’s according to The Washington Post. . The newspaper says people familiar with the probe didn’t say if the documents were recovered. . Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant. . The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed. . No man’s land that President Biden is preparing to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections. . That sets up a potential we match with Donald Trump. . Those close to President Biden describe him as upbeat about recent legislative economic and foreign policy victories. . Polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate. . San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley says the cooler inflation reading for July is welcome and she believes it may be appropriate for the Fed to lower its interest rate increases to 50 basis points next month. . Still Daley told Bloomberg TV the fight against inflation is far from over. . She says rate hikes need to be dependent on data. . Three of China’s biggest state owned companies plan to delist from U.S. . exchanges. . That’s fallout from a dispute over whether American regulators should be allowed to inspect audits of Chinese businesses that are listed in the U.S.. . The three companies that will delist a channel eye patch China and Sinopec. . The way has been cleared for Samsung vice chairman Jay Wiley to formally take the helm of the electronics conglomerate. . South Korea’s President Yoon Sook. . You’ll clear the air to the country’s biggest company on bribery charges. . Lee spent 18 months in prison before his release on parole a year ago. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. . I’m rich kid Gupta to. . This is good. . Justice Department has filed a motion in the southern district of Florida to unseal a search warrant and property receipt relating to a court approved search that the FBI conducted earlier this week. . That search was a premises located in Florida belonging to the former president. . Whatever your politics these are delicacies of classified material. . We’re going to dive into that right now here with futures up 16 Dow futures up one away. . I’m in a corner lift to the market on a Friday. . We’ll see where we go. . Here’s we just to the weekend we note Brent crude punching him a hundred dollars a barrel moments ago. . But the focus on Washington this weekend it’s sort of difficult to imagine how we get to the Sunday talk shows. . Thanks for their support on Bloomberg Radio. . Emily Wilkins briefs with Bloomberg government in Washington. . Emily there are three levels of classified material. . It’s sort of a modern world definition of confidential secret and top secret. . But within that there are some hugely delicate topics particularly under top secret including from 1954 coming out of Korea. . What we see with restricted data and formerly restricted data what is the what if if some of these classified materials were restricted data. . I mean the big concern here is really national security. . The fact that according to The Washington Post reporting that some of these documents that the FBI was looking for related to nuclear data nuclear weapon information. . Now of course we don’t know a lot of details yet. . We don’t know if this had to do with U.S. . nuclear weapons with other countries nuclear weapons. . If that data was even found by the FBI when they did their search of Mar a Lago. . So I think there’s a lot left to be determined but we are hoping to find out more potentially as soon as today. . Now that former President Trump has said that he is going to engage his lawyers to go ahead and to unseal that warrant that’s pretty visible and laid out. . I guess we’re going to see something today maybe end of the weekend. . But what you’re interested in Emily is the affidavit which is the documents and persuasion the parties used with a judge to invade to search the president’s residence. . I mean yes. . I think the main question that we’re all trying to answer right now is why did the FBI need to search Mar a Lago. . How much was at risk for this particular search. . How much was on the line as far as U.S. . security and national security goes. . I mean those are all sort of the big questions. . I mean smarter legal minds than mine. . Mine isn’t even a legal mind. . We’ll be passing through the war when it is revealed. . We’ll be passing through things. . I will let them do the analysis. . At this point. . I think one interesting thing to say in Washington is that we saw a lot of Republicans come out with very strong statements after the FBI ISE search on Mar a Lago. . We really have not heard a lot of Republicans weighing in since Attorney General Merrick Garland presser the other day. . I think a lot of them are now waiting to see what exactly happens with this warrant and what happens when things are unsealed. . We now turn on a Friday to our legal mind. . Lisa Abramowicz it was going to ask us about the legal side more about the political side. . And we saw shift gears and also plead ignorance. . But I do wonder whether the Republicans are using this as a talking point and calling it a raid and having it be a sort of thumping aspect whether it’s working in the polls. . I mean at this point it is a little too soon to tell. . Usually you know polling takes a couple days to get done and make sure that it’s all correct and well analyzed. . But at this point we are seeing a bit of a boost for Democrats. . If you look at the generic ballot if you look at polls sort of asking folks whether they’d rather have Republicans or Democrats in control. . This was a really great week for the Democratic Party. . The fact that the House is on track to pass that health climate care climate climate change and tax bill today. . But the fact that you saw President Biden have those two bill signings one for the chips and semiconductors one for a toxic firm pets and extending that care to veterans who have been impacted by it. . Democrats are really going to be able to claim a lot of wins. . And they’re in the position that when they can go home to their constituents in their districts they can talk the lie about what they’ve been doing. . Plus the CPI data was really good for Biden this week. . Obviously it’s lots of questions about what those numbers are going to look like in coming months. . We still have eight point five percent but at least Democrats are have the potential scenario that it’s peaked. . OK. . So the Democrats notching some wins ahead of the midterms. . But of course looking farther out there is a long way to go until 2024 Emily. . Yet we have fresh Bloomberg reporting from overnight about President Biden’s intention to run again if the matchup is Biden and Trump. . Is there confidence in Washington specifically among the Democratic Party that Biden would be the winner in that scenario. . There actually is. . I mean when you talk to Democrats a lot of them will point out very quickly that even though Biden doesn’t have a really great approval rating right now when he’s paired up against Trump he winds up on top and narrow margins. . But but still still out there. . And that’s why Biden ran in the first place. . Right. . That’s what he’s talking about running again. . The more likely it becomes that Trump is going to have another run in 2024. . The more Biden things that he needs to be that candidate to run and then cut to the chase. . You’re going to have a mint julep this weekend with the senator from Kentucky Mr. . McConnell. . Is he giving up his House majority. . I mean is the Republicans screwed this up so bad they could actually come down to a few seats of majority or even lose it. . Is Greg Jihye Lee value you alluded to this morning. . You know it’s a really great question Tom. . And the community he touched on the point that it’s not it’s both the House and the Senate. . Right. . It’s like Mitch McConnell. . He’s got to be a little bit worried right now. . You’ve seen a number of Senate Republican candidates falter a little bit in their campaigns haves you know a number of negative stories written about them. . A lot of questions about the ability for Republicans to win in states like Georgia in states like Pennsylvania at this point. . And then again as you mentioned Greg Valliere had a great piece this morning about the house that it was initially looking like Republicans would have this wave election like they would have a large majority next year. . Now there are questions about whether or not that’ll be the case. . Now Greg as well as a number of other really smart analysts do think that Republicans are still going to win the House in this November. . There’s that historical precedent there now that’s in their favor. . You know inflation is still high. . So dark suspecting at this point for Republicans to win. . But if Republicans only have really narrow margins that might limit what they’re able to get done especially if Democrats are able to hold the Senate. . Emily will could sink so much. . Greatly appreciate it this morning. . I’ll tell you a legal big Lisa Abramowicz. . I mean it’s incredible how I’m reading background on this trying to keep up with you or Garrett Graff or others really on the high ground on this. . Well and the subpoena that we that was presented to president former President Trump was not revealed and will not be revealed. . And that actually is more details what he actually had to present to the. . Judge to make the argument for why they could do that. . The affidavit the affidavit. . Excuse me. . Yes incredible legal mind. . Legal veto makes it all. . Yeah exactly. . If you try to fill me into the rolls Caylee’s gone period. . Yeah. . Had to Google it yesterday time. . I think you should Google. . Friday futures up 15. . Dow futures up 1 to 1. . The VIX twenty point one seven. . Stay with us. . This is Bloomberg. . Bloomberg Surveillance on a Friday. . We’re getting you into the weekend the refrain here on equities bonds currencies commodities and of course the various and sundry news flows hydrocarbons front center today with Brent crude print of hundred on the way back up over the last number of days you’re watching natural gas in Europe all of the massive challenges there. . The chart of the week without question having a blast on electricity in France. . Truly a moonshot and a moonshot of worry there I should say. . Katie Lyons in for Jonathan Ferro. . I just I just want to say gentlemen had this out on Twitter. . And I mean Lisa and I were talking about it over breakfast at the at the St. . Regis yesterday. . And and Lisa the truth is the pharaoh is gone full European. . I mean you know this was not one one day halls that I would take. . This was like a substantial gap. . Basically someone on Twitter saying that’s so European. . What do we again. . Do we expect him Monday. . I mean perchance. . I believe so. . We believe so. . How things go. . Kailey Leinz or the short straw joins us today. . And that’s a good thing as well right now. . Q Julie Anticipated for November is a book but when Stephen Roach writes a book on China it has a focus and intent on their economics and politics like no other. . The book is Accidental Conflict America China and The Clash of False Narratives. . This is hugely anticipated by the Chinese watching community. . The gentleman from Yale and the size China’s center at Yale Law School joins us this morning. . Dr. . Rose thank you so much for joining. . You’ve written three or four books on China. . Why is this one different. . What is the tension at this moment. . Is Mr Xi goes to the party Congress. . Well time in the past five years we’ve gone from trade war to tech war to now a Cold War conflict is escalating. . There is no real framework to manage this conflict effectively let alone conceive of even the slightest semblance of resolution and enough period of escalating conflict. . The smallest spark can lead to a major clash and we certainly have seen one in the last week over Taiwan. . And I’m very worried about the possibility of a military accident in the Taiwan Straits occurring in the context of this escalating economic and technology conflict that could really lead to a serious outbreak between the United States and China. . The thesis of the book is the conflict would not have happened were it not for the false narratives that both nations harbor with respect to other. . And I develop these narratives in detail in the new book. . Well what is important here is what matter of diplomacy is needed. . What is the roach approach to a new diplomacy that can perhaps calm down these pressure points. . Well my idea and I develop it in detail on the final part of the book is that the current structure of engagement whether it’s the leader to leader phone call between Biden and Xi Jinping or earlier strategic and economic dialogues is grand. . Science has failed miserably. . And so I am proposing a permanent institution that I call for lack of a better term a U.S. . China secretariat that meets full time 24/7 staffed by an equal number of professionals on both sides of the relationship whose full time job is to deal with all aspects of the relationship from economics and trade to cyber and human rights. . And we need a new approach. . And this is one idea may not be perfect but it certainly beats the current failed approach. . Steve know there might be a lot of uncertainty on the policy side but businesses have to make moves. . They have to either expand and double down on their expansion plans in China or they have to withdraw which we’ve seen a number of companies do on the margins. . And we hear more and more about reassuring or on shoring of U.S. . companies away from China. . How materially will that shift the dynamic of trade at a time when a lot of people say this will be inflationary. . Well I think I think it will be inflationary. . I think that the trend toward reassure reassuring is an unmistakable outgrowth of geostrategic tensions between the United States and China. . They can better be addressed through a structure such as the one I just outlined. . Lisa. . But you know make no mistake this is very destabilizing not just for the U.S. . and inflation but also for China. . China benefited the most of any nation in the world from the upswing of globalization and it has the most to lose. . I think as we now move from globalization to deal globalization there’s a larger issue though for the economy. . And this is something that we were just hearing about from Ron Temple how he thinks that perhaps he’ll get back down to a 3 percent inflation rate but not much below that because we are in a new paradigm. . And I wonder how much is China the main part of that. . If you have reassuring which incurs more expense and you have slower growth in China because of exactly what you said because this is going to affect the world’s second biggest economy significantly. . How much does this portend a slower growth higher inflation environment for a longer term. . Well you know we debate how much China has held down U.S. . inflation over the past 20 years but it’s been significant as has the rapid expansion of global value chains or global supply chains. . And as supply chains are disrupted by China and other developments around the world. . As we move from offshore to onshore. . Good luck in getting inflation down to 3. . It’s going to be a very difficult goal to achieve. . Steve I’ve been dying to ask you this ship built Morgan Stanley economics. . You were the first American economists I know that tried to make a three legged Fed policy of unemployment inflation. . And you said watch the balance sheet the expansion of the balance sheet. . All that came true is you wrote about years ago. . What’s the Fed theory now if you were to if you were to parachute into Jackson Hole here at the end of Marcus. . What is the theory you’re going to find about central banking. . Well you know hard for me to know how they’re going to phrase it Tom but I think the Fed theory has got to go back to basics. . You know forget this QE balance sheet asset dependent economy it’s blown up repeatedly since Greenspan and Bernanke tried it in the 90s and the early 2000s. . The Fed’s got to go back to inflation targeting not average inflation targeting but plain old inflation targeting. . And we need a you know a dose of the very simplistic but tough and disciplined approach by Paul Volcker. . Jay Powell is it says he’s very much committed to doing this. . The Fed’s taking some big steps but. . Right. . Child’s play compared to what they have to do. . The real federal funds rate is still sharply negative. . You’re not going to control inflation with a sharply negative. . That’s that’s on the Elam side. . OK. . Help me here with the real economy and the unemployment rate. . If we go out Lawrence Summers this morning and pop it up as Anna Wang at Bloomberg says to a 4 percent or 5 percent regime what does that do to America’s unemployment rate. . It’s going to go up Tom. . I mean you know we’ll give you a man to sit here. . No one’s watching. . Give me give me a man somewhere in the 4 to 5 percent zone which is you know a small price to pay. . No not for those who are affected by it of course but a small price to pay to get inflation back under a more stable path consistent with sustainable growth in the US. . The path we’re on right now doesn’t cut it. . OK so Stephen obviously there is a tradeoff potentially between keeping inflation in check and supporting growth and to tie it back to China. . The PBS see earlier this week was saying we aren’t going to go with massive stimulus to support the economy despite the turmoil in the property sector with the Covid zero policy causing issues because we are worried about the specter of inflation. . Do you expect that eventually if China isn’t going to take steps to breach a five and a half percent growth target that the Federal Reserve is going to back to. . Well I think you know that. . Are you asking about the Fed’s concerns over U.S. . economic growth. . Yeah. . I think the you know the mandate is going from dual to single inflation is the focus and they can’t afford to flinch on bringing inflation back because of political pressures that will be evident as the unemployment rate starts to rise. . And the Fed has just got to be fierce and focused on its independence and on his desire to bring inflation down as soon as possible. . Stephen Roach wonderful to catch up with you today of course at Yale Law School and formerly with the Wall Street firm named Morgan Stanley as well. . Lisa I really can’t say how alone Steve Roach was 20 years ago in saying this is a Fed policy that is just not simplistic. . NBER and congressional mandated policy that there was a sophisticated mix to the weights they would have to confront. . You asked earlier this morning what those notes were going to be like over the weekend. . What concessions there would be for some of the big bears. . What do you see and how much is it going to be this this sort of structural inflation that people are not counting for if the Fed wants to get back down to their 2 percent limit. . If they don’t take it. . Adam Posen 3 percent view of things. . Well then are we a lot further from that place than people think. . Is it a lot less attainable with the kind of growth that we have enjoyed in the recent past because of this reassuring on shoring the separation of the two powers. . We’ll just have to see. . Jeff the graph here over run macro. . Neil Dutta notes what many others have noted today. . We’ve had a 50 percent move what’s called a retracement up off the bottom of this grim bear market. . And it’s now what. . For the market it’s any number of themes there in guesses of where we’ll go. . Futures up 17. . Dow futures up one way. . McKinley I guess we’re all doing that. . We’re all in anticipation of what equity strategists are going to write this weekend. . Yeah I can’t wait to see if we see any actual revisions to year end targets especially for the bears out there that we’re warning a margin pressures. . Talking about producer price inflation putting pressure on companies and yet that came in cool too. . Does that start to change the fundamental calculus as well and make this not just a meltdown maybe August and that we’re looking for a not year end. . I mean things are so original right now. . Covid version we’ve gone from negative 49 basis points to negative 30 for less inverted. . This is Bloomberg. . Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word answers you could get to. . There’s a report that among the items FBI agents searched for at Donald Trump’s Florida home were classified documents related to nuclear weapons. . According to The Washington Post people familiar with the investigation didn’t say if those documents were found. . Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant. . The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed. . President Biden wants four more years. . Bloomberg Surveillance. . The president is set to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections. . Those close to Bloomberg says he’s encouraged by recent legislative economic and foreign policy successes. . But polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate. . Ukraine’s ambassador to Washington is cautioning the U.S. . and its allies against fatigue over a war that’s costing billions in security assistance. . Oksana Michael Barr told Bloomberg that it would be far costlier in the end to let Russia’s president Vladimir Putin go unchallenged. . She says that if Putin isn’t stopped in Ukraine he’ll attack other countries in Europe. . Today the Rhine River is likely to shrink to a level that could disrupt the transport of fuel throughout Europe. . The effects could ripple through the continent for months. . The water level at a key waypoint west of Frankfort is set to go below about 16 inches and continue dwindling. . That makes it uneconomical for barges carrying coal and oil to transit the river. . And in the UK the economy shrank in the second quarter for the first time since the pandemic. . The gross domestic product fell one tenth of one percent. . Though retail sales and the first drop in household consumption in more than a year were factors. . So it was declining Covid testing and vaccinations. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries which could get to. . This is Bloomberg. . They’re significant in that they’re saying we’re seeing some improvement but they’re not victory. . We haven’t read inflation report and unemployment report coming out before the next meeting really behooves us to stay data independent and not call it Mary Daly of the San Francisco Fed widely anticipated there. . And of course the heated battle into the weekend of different components as we just heard from Steve Roach of Yale Law School. . Good to hear from him as well. . Right now on the markets there’s a lift to the markets. . Got a Friday feel to it. . And Lisa even mentioned this in anticipation of retail sales next week. . Yeah. . And actually those are no good days. . But today’s Friday retail sales are next week. . I just want to point this out that Citi put out a report saying that their credit card transaction chat transaction data excuse me it is Friday clearly shows a decline in spending in certain retail areas and it’s pretty much across the board. . This is in nominal terms. . So in real terms even more. . How does that factor into this disinflationary environment is just feet at Tom at a time when a lot of people are counting on soft landing now that reported in next week as well. . Right now we’re going to digress here. . I thought what Lisa was talking was Dr. . Shiller about on the break was really really important. . Wendy Shiller’s with Brown University director of the Taubman Center for American Politics and a writer of core textbooks on our civics as well. . We’ve alluded to this before Wendy but I want to talk about two candidates who I believe will be 78 and 82. . In 2024. . And that means if my math is right there’ll be 82 and 86 on the way out the door in two thousand twenty eight. . How did we get the fossils running for president. . Well I think general trends in aging are are good and people are aging better across the country. . So that’s a good thing. . I think in time that came out of a very long where people thought was a very long recession and the world has become less stable. . Obviously the Cold War ended and we all celebrated freedom around the world but freedom brought with it a lot of unpredictability. . And then of course we had the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. . And when you have that much tumbled and uncertainty and certainly even the 9/11 attacks people want comfort. . They want people who’ve been around a long time could tell them to shoot. . This too shall pass. . People look to the familiar. . They look to people with quote unquote experience. . Donald Trump had business experience that he touted and Joe Biden had more than 30 years in government. . Wendy. . I’m struggling with that idea because we’ve seen poll after poll saying that they would like to see new blood put leading the Democratic Party. . They would like to see a younger slew of Congress members across the board as we enter into a very new phase. . Is it a good thing or a bad thing for the Democrats that President Biden announced his intention to run again. . I think it’s a good thing you can’t have a president not even ending his second year full year in office. . He says well I’m not in anymore. . I mean even if there’s the slightest chance Biden can still be president and a couple of years from now that makes a difference in terms of influence. . That makes a difference in terms of public opinion. . You just can’t be written off. . We saw this with Clinton after the Republicans won the midterms in 94. . You know he’s irrelevant. . He doesn’t. . He won two years later relatively easily. . You have to maintain the exercise of power and the illusion that you want to keep that power. . So I think that’s a strategically important thing for Biden to do and there isn’t a reason for him not to do it. . So you think that this is more about the visual is more about the illusion and less about a true intention to run. . Well I think he can stay. . He can stay in this race until somebody in the primary starts to beat him. . And you know the myth that primaries are bad for parties at the presidential level Azman has been debunked. . Now we know that it generates more turnout and generates people registering to vote knowing the polling places they get out the door. . There’s you know we know that it increases turnout amongst the party members. . So that means that it’s a good thing to have some fighting some challenging some anticipation. . So if he’s in it and other people want to challenge him that just means more Democrats get in the game to to vote. . And we know that Republicans will be very very energized in 24 to about whom they will be loyal. . We don’t know who they’re going to pick. . Right. . You know I think they’ll be more than one person in that race. . Yeah it’s a good point Wendy. . Obviously there’s multiple variables at play. . Let’s just assume for the moment that the 2024 candidate on the Republican side hypothetically would be President Trump. . Is there anyone on the Democratic side of likely potential candidate who would be able to beat him other than President Biden. . Well if the election were held today of unclear to me that anybody could except for Biden. . And again people like what they’re used to. . There’s been a lot of victories lately for the Democrats. . You know if economic conditions you know ease up I think that you know the president former President Trump is facing a lot of different inquiries. . Some of them are more scary than others I think to voters. . And again that core of independent suburban voters is key. . They rejected Trump in 2020. . And I think there isn’t any reason to think they’re going to welcome them back with open arms and 24. . So I think that’s what the Democrats are counting on. . But you know Pritzker an Illinois big state that Gavin Newsom in California big state. . Kathy Hochul if she wins again big in New York becomes a player. . And then of course there are a couple people in his cabinet that might want to run which makes for awkward cabinet meetings theoretically later on. . But we we are seeing energy. . Energy on the Republican side. . And now we’re starting to see a little bit more energy on the Democratic side. . You have to maintain the energy so you have to give them choice. . But you are the most powerful person in the world. . And why you would walk away from that two years early. . You know that’s just that’s political malpractice. . And Wendy finally if we could just look to the more immediate future and the midterms in November there was a sense prior to this week that Democratic momentum was building. . You have the inflation reduction at gas prices are coming down and it’s looking a little bit more optimistic for the Biden administration. . And yet as you allude to you now have this galvanizing force when it comes to President Trump’s base because of the FBI search of Mar a Lago. . Do those two forces cancel each other out. . And we’re now left with kind of the same outlook on the midterms as we had before. . That’s an outstanding question. . I think for Democrats though and again this independent group if Trump looks like this base of Trump’s is going to get out the door and there and they are behaving in ways that are frightening to some people like trying to bust into an FBI office with you know being armor being armed I think that scares suburban voters. . It scares independent voters. . And it looks like this will give Trump momentum. . I think the same forces that got the door 20 18 on the Democratic side will get out the door again. . You load up abortion on that in key states. . It’s going to be a referendum statewide. . I think that is going to help the Democrats. . I don’t know if it saves them for the House but it could very well save them for the Senate. . What it shows. . Thank you so much for joining us with an August update. . She is at Brown University here in the politics of the moment. . Lisa as you said there are the best in the year. . And you wonder just getting to August end. . Yes. . Two more. . Right now it’s just that large. . Her comments though were fascinating that when you get a contested primary which is unusual when you have a sitting president still running you get greater turnout you generate more interest. . There is a greater debate that brings eyeballs into the fold. . And that that actually could be helpful not only for the midterm elections but also for what we’re going to see in 2024. . It’s an interesting point lost under the headlines of really is he really going to run again. . He’s going to be 81 blah blah blah. . It’s an interesting point. . I would go back to the markets with this stunning move we’ve had since I think it’s June 16th. . There’s sort of two discussions going on into. . Sort of a reaffirmation by the financial system that things can recover versus all the myriad Kelly the myriad of uncertainties that are out there. . Removed from what we look at every day on Bloomberg Surveillance uncertainty on many policy fronts. . Tom when it comes to just policymaking in Washington D.C. . who ultimately is going to have the role of Congress and the legislative agenda and then policymaking on the side of the Federal Reserve. . How much really changed for them. . This week they say not much. . The market says otherwise. . Two avenues to good discourse on this balance of powers. . Look for that balance of power 12 noon David Westin. . And I’d really also mentioned Joe Mathews hard hitting sound on 5 p.m. . on Bloomberg Radio. . We say good morning. . This is Bloomberg. . I don’t know how long it will take to come down but clearly the momentum is down on inflation. . Yes they are coming down but I think they’re very far away from the Fed’s objective. . We look at other measures of inflation. . There’s still a lot of work for the Fed to do with the economy slowing and inflation is coming off. . They want to be sure they’re are on the right track. . I think the Fed looks at this had been as the beginning of of their battle and having been more credible but having more work to do. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz. . Good morning everyone. . Jonathan Ferro. . Lisa Abramowicz. . Tom Keene on radio. . On television Lisa. . Finally a point. . This reallocation Friday everybody out there is gonna rewrite for the weekend CPI while the jobs report was wow retail sales next week. . That’s going to be while everybody has to adjust. . So time are going to pull the trigger out of a triple leverage all cash into reallocating into bitcoin or say all big tech. . I’m going to take the worst fractional shares of Apple maybe. . My point is when do you get in. . When do you see the bottom. . How far out. . Yes. . Look do you look out a month. . Do you say that this rally could continue because of technical reasons over the next three weeks. . Or do you start preparing for that yield curve inversion signal. . Yes it’s gotten less inverted but still signaling a slowdown that some people say hasn’t been priced in. . We did this with Ron Temple in the last hour Lazard Asset Management David Liebowitz. . We were zero moments with the JP Morgan really looking forward to this raging debate about what to do here and what to do here. . Lisa is always the fixed income market leads the way is the fixed income market leading equities know right now if the fixed income were leading it would send the same signal at least if you look at credit that equities are signaling which is if we get any kind of downturn it’s going to be shallow and the resilient companies are going to remain resilient and are going to be able to pay their bills. . And that is why you’re getting the biggest inflows into investment grade credit going back to September 21. . I do wonder though why are we still seeing yield curves inverted. . Why are we seeing such low longer term yields. . If people believe that we do have you know some sort of soft landing ahead that we can then revive from. . And so these are some of the conundrums baked into the bond market that’s not telling a consistent story. . Let me let me let me steal from John Lumiere over at MSNBC way too early. . Caley Lines is the queen of way too early in for John Farrow today. . Kelly you’re doing a more European show than we are. . Is there a believes that the hydrocarbon disaster of Europe can move over to the United States. . I think there is a sense Tom that the United States is going to be relatively more interested or insulated. . But obviously Europe is dealing with a substantial energy crisis one that is poised to potentially get Reuters beginning today when part of the Rhine River becomes impassible for cargoes of things like going through this. . I mean I don’t need a tour guide here. . You know I’m I’m scheduled to take the tour in 2025 to go Castle watching. . But the bottom line clearly is we can’t get coal. . So nat gas goes up. . Right. . Exactly. . And that is the problem that Europe is facing. . It is an energy driven inflationary shock in Europe one that central banks the ECB are poised to do very little about on the supply side. . And yet they are still trying to hike rates until a European economy that is weakening due to the very same energy crisis and the high cost of living. . Lisa from the Upper East Side e-mails and says get to the day to check. . I got to do the brief futures up 13. . Dow futures up 99. . The VIX under under 20 was a big deal for me. . Still twenty point one nine shows a resiliency of equities this week. . Fixed income it’s gyrating. . We have less curve and version now but nevertheless a negative 34 basis points is important. . Fair or not here I don’t know who’s doing the real yield. . I’m not doing the real yield. . The real yield points 3 8 percent here on a Friday. . Right now we need to be briefed. . It’s auction free. . Here’s Lisa Abramowicz and I will be doing real yield that we actually have real yield. . Just what to say across the board. . Even two year yields are real in inflation adjusted terms for the first time going back to before the pandemic which is a fascinating turn of events especially given the rally that we’ve been seeing today. . And this is what we’re looking for. . And if we had to perhaps frame the day differently it would have been University of Michigan sentiment Friday. . How much do we get an ongoing increase in terms of how people are feeling especially as you get a reprieve from gas prices. . This particular survey more closely tracks gas prices when they go up. . People feel worse when they go down. . People feel better. . How much do we start to see that really trickle into longer term inflation expectations. . And how much does the Fed respond to that at 12:00 p.m.. . This is the real world. . And what we saw in CPI ISE Wednesday was that food rose at the fastest pace going back for prices going back to 1979 in the United States. . How much can supply come back online. . How elastic Tom Keene is your words. . Is this market as we deal with drought across the country in the United States. . The USDA world agricultural supply. . Demand report comes out. . We get a sense of corn soybeans as well as what’s going to be forward for cotton and a whole host of other commodities. . And on Sunday Saudi Aramco reporting earnings. . We’re expecting to see a similar kind of boom in terms of earnings. . Do they give a sense of this to stories that we’re getting from the IEA and OPEC Tom. . Because right now we’re hearing from the IEA that the demand for oil is going to increase as people pivot from natural gas to oil to plug the supplies. . And then we hear from OPEC that there’s going to be a surplus. . So which is it. . And can Saudi Aramco give some sort of its name. . Very good. . Let’s get started here with two short a visit with David Liebowitz who’s global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. . And buried in your note on the struggles of this summer and getting to the fall in just trying to say OK. . I don’t want to run around my head. . Cut off is the idea that three years is the new short term. . How do you invest for three years as the new short term. . If the present is such a jumble. . So I think when it comes to three years let’s call that the medium term. . To me the key is to really focus on two things. . It’s the focus on valuation and it’s the focus on earnings power. . Stock markets have rerated so far this year. . July was a very good month. . And so prices aren’t necessarily looking as attractive as they did. . But when we look at the equity market today we still see fairly tremendous dispersion between the expensive names and the cheap names. . Now you know sometimes the expensive names have been over bid because people are too positive on their prospects for earnings. . Sometimes the cheap names are cheap for a reason. . And so it’s really blending that combination of value and earnings growth. . Almost a Gabi approach if you will. . That I think will be the best one to take over the course of the next couple of years. . David Leibovitz your colleague David Kelley over at J.P. . Morgan Asset Management yesterday said that stocks will revisit their all time highs and then surpass them in the next three years. . That actually is consensus. . If you look across the different Wall Street houses it’s the path to get there. . That really is the question. . What is the trajectory. . How low do we go before we go back up short. . So he is he he’s more than a colleague. . He’s actually my boss. . So I better. . No but I think it’s a reasonable point to make. . I think that over the next three years we will see new all time highs in the equity market. . Again you know to your point the question is much more so around how we get there. . And you know people are still talking about the Fed and the potential for a soft landing. . The reality is that the historical data does not suggest that the Fed is is terribly adept when it comes to landing the plane gently. . And so I do think that we’re going to be experiencing some turbulence here into the end of this year and the beginning of next year could easily go back down below four thousand thirty seven hundred. . That would connect the dots with the trend line that we were on prior to the pandemic. . But what I think the market wants to see here is it wants to see two things. . It wants to see the inflation genie going back into the bottle. . And then that’s somewhat obvious. . I also think that the market wants to see some deterioration in the labor market. . It’s it’s somewhat contrary. . But if we see the unemployment rate begin to rise after a very hot number in July that’s going to give the market confidence that what the Fed is doing is correct. . And if we do have a downturn it’ll be relatively short lived. . And so I think the market would be comfortable if it can’t get the soft landing with with a bumpy landing maybe a shallow recession. . But we need to see signals that labor is beginning to cool off. . That’s going to be instrumental to getting markets on a more positive trajectory. . David other than the conversation with your boss another conversation we had yesterday was with Jim Paulson of Lew’s Hold Group who essentially said he sees the case for additional Fed tightening rapidly dissipating and that ultimately it’s not the Fed that’s driving the boat right now. . It is the market which is consistently seeing pushing financial conditions into looser territory not paying attention to the commentary we’re getting out of Federal Reserve officials. . Who do you think’s ultimately going to end up on the right side of that. . So it is a bit concerning to see financial conditions loosened after back to back 75 basis point hikes. . I frankly think that the Fed is going to continue to move fairly aggressively here. . We’ll see what the futures pricing looks like when it gets closer to September. . But I do think that if the market is opening the door for the Fed to do another 75 basis points they’ll do it. . Because what the Fed is trying to do here is get policy into territory that is going to actively slow the economy. . I don’t think it’ll fight the futures market. . But again I think if that door opens up the Fed’s going to step right through it. . So by our lights the Fed is going to remain on on a relatively pre-set course into the end of the year. . What I think will get them moving in the opposite direction is a meaningful deterioration in the labor market. . But they are going to tolerate a higher unemployment rate than they have historically. . David we are drowning in history of the moment. . I mean the idea of a search of a former president’s residence just as one example you arguably went to the most prestigious history program in America Williams College the font of James MacGregor Burns. . How do we invest and adapt to the history in the making. . The James MacGregor Burns and others wrote about. . So I think what’s so. . Interesting about the current environment and you know we meet with clients across the United States and they always want to know what’s the big risk you know and usually it’s something that we’re able to tell is a big risk a threat to democracy. . We know it’s really rare that that is one what one angle to take. . But what I was going to say is you know there there are risks that we can see and there are risks that we can see but we have more difficulty getting our arms around if we see some sort of imbalance in the economy housing running to hot investment spending running to higher vehicle sales running too hot. . We can quantify that and we can begin to build expectations about what a reversal in that would mean for the outlook for economic growth. . The problem is the real risks in the current environment. . They’re coming from the social side of things. . They’re coming from the political side of things. . And those are very difficult to quantify. . And so you’ve been telling clients that when you can see a clear risk you can hedge against it. . Right. . Higher rates and a more hawkish fed when you can’t necessarily see the risk coming or you can’t quantify the risk that exists. . That’s when we diversify. . That’s when diversification is your friend. . David thank you so much. . And thank you for visiting today. . David live at center headquarters here with JP Morgan Asset Management. . Lisa I think this is a huge huge deal and it’s phrased differently now than anytime over 30 40 even 50 years. . And that is how do you invest with a cacophony of history and news flow we’re all dealing with now. . And what David just said there was brilliant that when you cannot see the risks you need to diversify what you can see the risks you can more accurately hedge. . And that is the moment that we’re seeing is channeling Peter Bernstein I would say. . Well there we are. . Thank you. . David Liebowitz again. . Futures up 12. . Dow futures up 85 again next week. . We look at retail sales coming up. . Jeffrey U V NY Mellon this is Bloomberg. . Keeping you up to date with these from around the world with the first right answers you can get at Bloomberg’s learned that President Biden is preparing to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections. . That sets up a potential rematch with Donald Trump. . Those close to President Biden describe him as upbeat about recent legislative economic and foreign policy victories. . Polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate. . FBI agents reportedly search Donald Trump’s Florida home for classified documents related to nuclear weapons. . That’s according to The Washington Post. . And he’s made this as people familiar with the probe didn’t say if the documents were recovered. . Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant. . The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed. . San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley says the cooler inflation reading for July is welcome and she believes it may be appropriate for the Fed to slow its interest rate increases to 50 basis points next month. . Still to Daley told Bloomberg TV the fight against inflation is far from over. . She says rate hikes need to be dependent on data. . Three of China’s biggest state owned companies tried to delist from U.S. . exchanges. . That’s fallout from a dispute over whether American regulators should be allowed to inspect audits of Chinese businesses that are listed in the U.S.. . The three companies that will do list are China Life Pet China and Sinopec CEO Shi Sun has now lost more than four billion dollars on a series of side deals. . He set up a Softbank to boost his compensation. . The Japanese billionaire took the unusual step of establishing personal stakes in a series of Softbank Ventures in recent years. . That was a mixing of company and executive interests that drew the ire of investors. . Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries and which could get to. . This is Olympic. . Former President Trump is exactly a former president. . He’s a citizen. . He’s not a president who has the ability or the the the law abiding notion that he can hold on to classified documents a notion somehow he might still have that information. . That in itself would constitute a crime that might touch a senator from Maine a former U.S. . secretary of defense William Cohen there on the political moment. . Add that and we welcome all of you right now. . Lisa I want to get to some very quickly. . I think it’s so important in the equity cave here at Bloomberg Media the guy that makes us go is Peter Deal Terrorists. . And he has a chart out today. . Lisa alludes to what you said earlier in the swing here in recent days of cash losing negative four point three billion in stocks gaining eighteen point one billion stardust. . Extraordinary. . Yes. . And it stocks and its credit lines. . It’s taking cash out and putting it into everything else somehow. . This has been a shift. . If you want to look at the Wall Street notes over the weekend fine. . But right now there’s a vote with the money and it very much is for a shift in reality. . Yeah. . People ask you this Peter. . Is it incense or murdered. . He uses and he’s sort of in there with both. . But in the cave the Merc can clear the air. . Peter thank you for that work this morning. . Emily Wilkins drives us forward. . A Bloomberg government right now we’ve been talking and talking and talking about these political events as Mr. . Trump a former president. . Let us move on from that to actually what may happen in Washington. . Is it the dog days of August in Washington. . Emily does the city roll up. . Well we’re hoping that maybe after today everyone can finally take a breath and get onto the August that we were all hoping to have at the start of this year. . You saw the Senate work all last weekend. . Pull those all night sessions trying to get through the what is left of President Joe Biden’s reckons proposed reconciliation package. . That’s the tax pieces the climate piece and the health care piece. . Senate got it done. . House’s turn is today. . They’re expected a final vote on that legislation around about 2 3 4 o’clock this afternoon. . It is expected to pass. . Sure. . Democrats did have their concerns with the bill. . The fact it didn’t have the state and local tax caps the fact it didn’t deal with immigration. . In fact it left a lot of other pieces on the cutting room floor. . But Tom just a few months ago they were looking at a reality where they didn’t get anything else passed and everyone kind of decided they’d rather take what they have now than to not take anything at all. . Emily we’ve focused on the potential for a legislative victory more than the substance itself at times. . And I do wonder how much you hear in Washington D.C. . under the hood of getting something done about the blowback from allies of the United States who are saying you’re crediting companies that really make cars make batteries make goods in the United States. . That affects us badly. . How are you going to help us. . I mean how does this affect the international relations of a nation trying to repair what’s been lost. . Well to a certain extent. . I mean that’s certainly a valid question and a valid angle to take a look at. . I think right now perhaps lawmakers are a little bit more focused particularly those who have re-election. . Coming up more of what’s happening in their own districts. . What can they sell to Americans. . What can they pitch to Americans. . And a lot of this is going to be things like extending some subsidies with the Affordable Care Act that were put in place during the pandemic. . There are concerns that you know your people if those aren’t extended folks are going to see their insurance premiums go up right before this election. . A similar things with climate change. . Obviously that’s a big priority for a lot of Democratic voters to be able to say that they got that done and things like that. . Minimum 15 percent corporate tax on certain corporations making are earning high amounts. . Democrats have seen that polling. . Polling shows that Americans are supportive of taxing companies and sort of making them pay their fair share. . So these are all policies that lawmakers can really go out and promote. . Of course there’s a lot of things that they were initially talking about child care tax credits a pre-K on a national level that just aren’t going to happen at this point. . And certainly there might be some concerns from Democrats that those things aren’t getting done at the same point. . The really the big attitude right now in Washington is something is better than nothing especially when the midterms are less than three months away now. . Emily as we get closer to that vote we’ve had a lot of conversation about a potential shift in the narrative the odds maybe skewing a little bit more in the Democratic Party’s favor than say just a few weeks ago. . But at the same time we know that American politics are extremely partisan and polarized. . How many minds realistically are left to change. . How many more swing voters are there. . You know it’s really funny you mentioned that Kelly. . I was in Michigan at the start of July of reporting on a House race there between two incumbents. . I did all this reporting and I talked to all these folks hours before the polls were going to close. . I got a text from my mom be like who should I vote for. . And it just reminded me that there are a lot of Americans. . They just they’re not thinking about Washington right now. . They’re not thinking about the CPI numbers. . They’re thinking about what they’re paying at the grocery store. . They’re thinking about how much they’re putting in their gas. . They’re focused on their own homes their own families their own communities. . And they’re not going to start thinking about this stuff until October. . So there’s still a lot of time for the narrative to change. . We’ve got more CPI reports coming out. . We obviously have more to the story of a search warrant in Mar a Lago. . A lot can change. . Believe that is absolutely textbook. . I’m imagining my mother who is to the right of John Birch up say food for Emily who’s going to vote in Wyoming for Miss Cheney here. . How is she. . Oh what level of down in flames is Liz Cheney going to go here on Tuesday. . So we’ve already seen Liz Cheney shift her messaging around this campaign. . It is no longer about winning this congressional seat. . It is more about what her legacy is going to be in Washington and team her up for the next chapter of her career whatever that is going to be. . We saw her make her final ad her final pitch to voters before Tuesday’s upcoming primary. . And it was basically all focused on Donald Trump and her saying that you know he’s a threat to this country. . He can’t be back as president and that she’ll do whatever she can to stop him. . It does not sound like your normal political ad and I think it really signals what we saw in the polling yesterday. . She’s 30 points behind. . She’s not gonna be able to hold the seat. . It’s just a question of what comes next. . Emily can we agree that Lynne Cheney. . Called up Liz Cheney said who should I vote for. . I think that there is a slightly different dynamic. . Billy thank you so much. . That was classic Emily Wilkins with Bloomberg Government in Washington. . I’m sorry Lisa. . That’s great. . I mean we’ve gone so far from where you know your father held you in his arms. . While you know you’ve got to push down the metal toggle switches and move the knob of the voting booth. . Miles we’re back to chads I guess is where we are. . It depends on where you go in some of the voting booths that I’ve been in in New York City. . They still have those men. . Let’s do this. . Oh yes they do. . They’re not electronic. . But do you know all of the people on a ballot. . All of the judges all of everyone on the local and on you know and beyond. . When you go to the voting booth. . No no I don’t. . And it’s a huge problem and really speaks to the television focus and indeed the radio focus as well at the national level where we may be less familiar with our local politics. . We’re familiar with the day to check here a lift to the market on a Friday. . Futures up 12 Dow futures up 90. . Again Jeff for you will attend. . Victoria Fernandez as well. . This is Bloomberg. . Good morning everyone. . Bloomberg Surveillance on a Friday. . Jonathan Ferro on assignment. . Lisa Abramowicz and Tom Keene Kailey Leinz holding court as well as Friday to go into the Friday and weekend reading. . It will be more than interesting particularly on what the equity markets will do. . Let me do a day to check right now. . Futures up 14 Dow futures up 1 0 5. . The VIX 19 level earlier twenty point one. . It’s still extraordinary given the move from June to higher yield three point to 1 percent. . We do have curve inversion but less curve inversion than pre CPI negative 34 basis points as well moving in from a greatly inverted negative forty nine basis points. . We had one hundred dollar print on Brent crude. . Moments ago an hour ago I should say ninety eight point four five gyrations in oil and natural gas this morning and the individual equity stocks. . Lisa pulled an all nighter to give. . Oh yeah. . All nighter analyzing revision and the electric vehicles. . They don’t get out of your head start with really. . Well really it is actually fascinating. . Their shares are lower right now by two tenths of a percent. . They actually beat expectations but they forecast a bigger than expected loss. . Here’s the problem. . They haven’t gotten production up to speed to meet all of the demand. . So they have people making orders two years in advance. . And then in the meantime the costs are going up. . Of the raw materials that they use for all of these goods. . So how do they deal with that without going back to a lot of these individuals and say hey give us our money which is not what they want to be doing on this company. . That is Jessica Alba is company that has home products. . It reported a worse than expected earnings but also a bigger than expected loss for the year. . Those shares down nearly three tenths of a percent and toast is surging. . I had not heard of toast before today. . Towns struggling today. . I mean these are all down. . OK so Joe’s restaurant. . Sorry. . Yes thank you. . It’s restaurant software. . And it’s up more than 13 percent. . I find this interesting because it comes after Doordarshan. . Others outperform. . How much are the delivery services people order again. . Really doing well. . OK. . In other news today the Chinese DAX really sounds like this is boring. . Go back to auctions. . Petro China and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp. . both plummeting after saying that they were going to delist from the New York Stock Exchange come mid September. . And this comes after a lot of pressure from China plummeting. . They were they had fallen more significantly. . Now they’re down just one point two percent two point four percent respectively. . And I’m pointing to Bed Bath and Beyond not because they reported earnings but every day when I come in I look at Bed Bath and Beyond and AMC to see whether the Reddit jury is still still going strong whether you still have the Robin Hood traders the individual traders and it is still on a tear. . So up 4 percent because why not. . Kelly was at the worst stock market report we’ve ever had. . I mean that was like a Friday struggle. . No I’m I’m all for it. . I think she nailed it. . Dude like Facebook do nothing yesterday or worse. . It’s called meta now. . Tom BODETT Tesla Free. . I mean I just. . I know but I think to her point on Bed Bath and Beyond and yes we all laugh about checking the meme stocks when we come into the morning. . It speaks of the speculative fervor that in some areas of the market is back. . Isn’t that the exact opposite of the conversation we were having just about a month ago when the Fed’s tightening policy. . You don’t want to be in those areas and yet we’ve seen a renaissance. . So what signal does that send more broadly. . Nice security there. . Kailey Leinz let’s have you bring in Victoria Fernandez chief market strategist across Mark Global Investments out of Rice in Texas S.M.. . Ms. . Hernandez understands speculative fever. . Kelly pick it up please. . Well Victoria just to that point the behavior we have seen not just in those more speculative assets but really just risk assets in general this equity market rallying is in a bear market rally to you or is it something you can actually buy. . Yeah I’m not 100 percent convinced that this is a sustainable rally at this point in time. . Kaylie I mean you look at some of the signals that that you want to see when you hit that bottom and then you get a sustainable rally. . And a week and a half ago we didn’t have many of those. . We’re getting a few more of them. . Now you’re looking at the number of stocks making their 20 day highs. . You’re looking at those that are trading above their 20 and their 50 day moving averages. . And those numbers are starting to move higher into the ranges where you want to see them. . But I think when you’ve got this fed that is just determined to continue to raise rates until they really cause a little bit of pain within the labor market and bring that inflation number down then I think you have to be concerned that there’s still going to be some some volatility going around. . And the rally that we’ve seen in the market over the last month was really just driven by lower yields. . It wasn’t driven by earnings. . It wasn’t driven by equity premiums. . So I think you have to be careful because now as we’re seeing rates move a little bit higher that could cause some consternation for the equity markets. . OK so you’re essentially saying Victoria that the Fed is going to stamp this out that they are actually going to push back on loosening financial conditions because they want them tighter and they may be more aggressive than just saying the words as we’ve heard over the last week and change. . I think that’s absolutely correct. . I mean look financial conditions are looser now than they were in March when we started this. . It shouldn’t be that way. . Right. . We should have seen those continue to get tighter and tighter as the Fed moves rates up. . But look you had the CPI and the PPA reports. . Yes it was positive but I don’t think it is any kind of game changer for the Fed. . I mean month over month CPI didn’t go higher. . OK that’s great. . But that doesn’t mean that we’re actually on this downward trajectory for that number for those economic report. . So I think the Fed is going to continue to do the rate hikes. . I mean is it 50 or 75. . I mean I’m not sure. . Flip a coin at this point. . I don’t think it makes too much of a difference in the market reaction. . The important thing is the trend here and the trend I think is going to continue to be higher. . The reports coming out next month will be key. . I think in determining which one of those hikes we see said do you play this in real time Victoria. . To basically push against big tech to push against some of the biggest gainers over the past few trading sessions. . Yeah you really got to watch those trends. . Lisa I mean you’ve got a lot of these names that have been beaten down so badly. . They’re doing better now but they’re still in downward trends. . And we’ve seen that in some of the discretionary names. . We’ve seen it in some of the industrial names. . So I think you want to be careful and be really choosy when you go in there. . We still like some of the like HMO and insurance names something like a Cigna or a MetLife. . We like some of the consumer staple names. . Probably our most recent purchase we’ve done across some of our large cap strategies is Coca-Cola. . And again we’re focusing on these balance sheets. . We’re focusing on their debt ratios on the quality of their earnings. . We think this is where you’re going to find some advantage if we continue to have some volatility and the Fed keeping their foot on the gas to Victoria. . We’re about 90 some odd percent all through this earnings season. . I just did a stock mover that Tom called the worst ever because it was not full of really big names. . And they’re all these little stories that tell a very different story of how strong or weak the economy is how much to earnings matter as you talk more about the Fed and how much they’re going to push back against the overall rally. . It didn’t matter as much this past month as I actually thought they were. . I mean like we said most of the rally was driven by the move lower in yields but I think it was because we thought margins would get compressed a little bit more. . We thought we would see earnings revisions come in more than what we did during the second quarter. . And it wasn’t a great earnings season. . But I think it was better than people expected. . So it allowed to give a little bit of support to the market. . But going forward we are seeing those revisions come in for the second half of this year and for early 2023. . So I think it’s going to pay a play a bigger role going forward as we see corporations margins really start to get hit. . We’re hearing about layoffs. . So those are some concerns. . But look let’s say you watch the bond market closely as do I and spreads have actually started to tighten a little bit. . So the bond market is telling us they’re not too concerned right now. . I think it’s going to be an interesting battle as we go through the next earnings season. . Victoria I want to pick up on Lisa said there because I think it is a I’m making a joke about Lisa’s equity. . I think it was sterling actually folks for your Oscar consideration. . But Victoria seriously here should I lose viewers and listeners pay any attention to the bed bath and Beyond to the world. . Or should they focus on Apple. . I mean which matters. . Well I think it depends on what your perspective is as an investor. . If you’re going in there and you’re really trying to do this daily trading and you’re and you’re trying to be very much on top of the momentum and the trends then I think it does pay to look at some of these more main type of stocks just to get an idea of where the retail traders are in kind of the volatility on a day to day basis. . When you’re looking a little bit longer term and I know you were speaking with David Liebowitz earlier about you know three year being the new short term. . But if you’re looking three five years out then I think you’ve got to look at some of these bigger players. . I mean Apple has become such a large holding in the index. . I think it’s at the largest percentage that it’s ever been. . You’ve got to watch these names and see what their momentum is looking like and follow those trends. . So for us. . Right. . Going to be looking a little bit more towards those big player. . What does Coca Cola’s attributes. . It makes an apple like yeah I mean look you’ve got this global player. . You have a strong balance sheet. . And what did they say when their earnings I mean their earnings were pretty stellar. . And a point in time when many people were concerned about the consumer and they’re saying we’re not really seeing that. . You had a lot of companies talk about the dollar being a strong headwind. . Coca Cola’s managing that as well. . So if you look at something that’s considered a staple in this market an environment where you’re expecting volatility and then it from a company that says they’re seeing still a strong consumer going forward I think that’s a name you can have in your portfolio and feel pretty confident about it. . Victor thank you so much. . Victoria Fernandez across from global investors they’re fired up about what to do next. . And least to me you know really that is what this August Friday is about is as you mentioned earlier and I get the idea of framing out the year in just framing up past Labor Day now as a reach. . Honestly it could be one data point that everyone shifts off once again. . You know we got this wage tracker a data from the Atlanta Fed yesterday. . It did not show any slowing down whatsoever. . In fact it was pretty much steady and under the hood. . There were signs of strength. . At what point do people key into that. . At what point do people key into if oil prices start to climb again does that change the entire narrative to your point. . Yeah. . This is my quarter. . He said Kelly jump in here as well. . Do no class or wage trackers. . Are they nothing more than marketing efforts by central banks. . I mean I just don’t you know we’ve got forty seven indices now all competing with each other to tell us where we are. . Do they have any value. . It’s a fair question Tom especially as we hear Federal Reserve official after Federal Reserve official saying forward guidance has gone. . We’re just going to depend on the data. . So how much is that really the hard data the economic data that crosses the wire. . And you see on Burke terminal versus these casts of all various shapes and sizes. . I thought it was really interesting that interview we had with Mary Daly the exclusive Kathleen Hays. . And she said pointing out there is another CPI read there is another jobs report before we can even get to the September meeting. . So a data dependent Fed is going to wait for more before making a call. . This week alone is not going to do it. . What’s really important folks you’re going to see this rolled out on Monday. . The Brown go back to school now. . Really looking. . What did you call it. . Advertising propaganda. . Yeah. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world to the best read. . I’m sure you can check. . There was a report that among the items FBI agents searched for at Donald Trump’s Florida home were classified documents related to nuclear weapons. . According to The Washington Post people familiar with the investigation didn’t say if those documents were found. . Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant. . The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed. . President Biden wants four more years. . Bloomberg’s land. . The president is set to launch his reelection campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections. . Those close to Bloomberg say he’s encouraged by recent legislative economic and foreign policy successes. . But polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate. . Today the Rhine River is likely to shrink to a level that could disrupt the transport of fuel throughout Europe. . The effects could ripple through the continent for months. . The water level at a key waypoint west of Frankfurt is set to go below about 16 inches and continued dwindling. . That makes it uneconomical for barges carrying coal and oil to transit the river. . France is calling on the European Union for help in fighting wildfires that have been blazing for days. . Germany Greece Poland Romania and Austria are sending resources. . France is in the worst drought on record. . Meanwhile in England a summer of heatwaves has led the government to declare that large parts of the country are in a drought. . England recorded its driest July since 1935. . And in China developers have suffered a meltdown of at least 90 billion dollars in stocks and dollar bonds this year. . And a bursting housing bubble and a debt crisis may make matters worse. . Meanwhile Beijing a signal that homeowners are the priority of efforts to stabilize the slumping housing market not build this global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries and which could get to. . This has been back. . This is the biggest concern above energy and that is food costs. . You look at the potential harvest this fall. . Not only is offroad diesel price for farmers rising. . Farm equipment is rising. . All of our costs. . So we’re looking at continued food costs because we cannot alter our behavior when it comes to food. . You can of gasoline not with food. . Stephen Schork absolutely on fire. . I believe that was yesterday with the Schork Report. . I really can’t say enough about the granularity of his effort. . And he is on absolute fire about natural gas dynamics right now. . We welcome all of your most interesting Friday. . We’re reading Emily Chang. . I’m reading all weekend and revision to try to figure out that disaster Kailey Leinz in for John Farrell. . John. . John is like back Monday. . Kelly right. . I mean affirmative. . I at the very least Tom I will not be. . I talked to him at the Rome airport. . I really have lost track of where he is now. . But I believe there has been a pharaoh sighting on a recapitulation we just talked about. . And we’ll have team coverage of this on Bloomberg Radio later. . And that is the Brando Back to school now cast. . This is a series that’s being put together by Bloomberg surveillance. . Alisa this begins with the haircuts that our parents never imagined what it would cost. . Yeah I took my my 13 year old son to get his haircut and I had a full bar there and it was sort of a real back to school. . Welcome for the parent. . I do wonder though as we talk about now Cassie you really think it’s propaganda marketing material for different Fed shops. . I think they’re taking well-intentioned time series and trying to brand them to media. . I’ll take the Cleveland CPI which I adore the great work of Cleveland. . Guilty as charged for us. . And they’ve got a mark thing as well. . All I remember is the biggest problem with back to school supplies was sixteen Creoles or 24 rich kids had 24 Creoles and one guy had seventy two Creole. . Is there I was Lisa was sixteen Creole. . And we’ll call Dr. . Phil after the dog chewed the magenta right now. . Dennis Gartman joins me with futures up 14. . Always good to speak. . The gentleman chairman of the University of Akron’s Endowment Fund. . He’s retired. . No he’s not. . He’s still writing the Gartman letter on an hour by hour basis and joins us today. . Dennis Lisa wants to talk about bonds. . I want to talk about hydrocarbons. . You know they’re out of control in Europe. . They’ve got a modest matter of a war. . Are we going to see methane natural gas. . Are we going to see different forms of gasoline in America. . Surge like electricity in France. . Probably so. . Propane is probably going to go a lot higher. . Nat gas is probably going to go a lot higher. . Inventories are extremely limited here in the United States. . They’re unbelievably limited in Europe. . If we start pushing nearby nat gas through nine dollars per million British thermal units nor trading about eight dollars and fifty eight dollars and 60 cents per million British thermal units if we start moving through nine dollars you start to go back to where we were in 2005 2006 and 2007 when we get 13 dollars per million British thermal units. . So you have to be very careful. . Things are very tight and likely to get tighter. . So it’s it’s not a pretty sign out there right now. . And you’re talking about natural gas and ISE but it could also apply this to certain oil inventory reports. . There are some different ones. . And I wonder how much we are fragile heading into the winter to see a spike in oil that could reverse some of the optimism about the disinflation that we’ve seen in this week’s reports. . Keep an eye on the term structure. . That’s that tells you more than anything else about what goes on in crude oil specifically especially historical commodities such as crude oil. . We’re in a small backwardation we were in and the larger backwardation a month and a half ago the backwardation has narrowed. . But in the past couple days as prices could all have fallen just a little bit taken we got what WTI and eighty eight dollars per barrel the other day and the nearby backwardation began to widen marginally. . Backwardation is where sophisticated and informed money leaves its footprints. . And if the backwardation starts to widen a bit we’re going to start seeing crude oil start to go higher again. . So I think you’ve seen most of the decline in crude oil NIKKEI did upon a decline in driving. . Miles here in the United States is the demand and decline in demand for gasoline and diesel. . I think you start to see it. . Eighty eight dollars a barrel. . That’s probably the low. . And I bet I bet we trade 95 96 97 and not too distant future. . So keep an eye on the backwardation. . A widening backwardation is always bullish for the crude oil market. . Well so let’s transfer that a 95 96 dollar a barrel a barrel price forecast here into your projection for the economy from markets especially because a lot of the trading activity has hinged on this lower oil price. . How much does that reverse the gains that we’ve seen in stocks and send yields higher. . I’m afraid that we’ve seen that the the the low on yields we’re going to see the much higher prices and yields much much lower prices and bond. . You had something that occurred last week which I think not enough people paying attention to. . You had an outsider reversal a week and outside a rehearsal day and the long bond future. . Very rare circumstance. . We’ve only seen a one time before here and we’ve only seen it two or three times in the course of the last five or six years. . When you have an outsider reversal I pay attention to it. . It’s one of the it’s one of the technicals that I pay great. . A great deal of need to an outsider. . Reversal week is a very rare event. . Probably means lower bond prices probably means higher yields over the course of next several weeks the next several months. . Be careful. . And I think that that’s the. . The decline that we’ve had in the long bond for the long bond yields over the course of last month and a half was predicated upon a decline in inflation decline in crude oil prices declining grain prices decline in livestock prices a decline in copper prices and all those turning around and turning back to the upside. . So be careful out there. . Keep an eye on gold. . It starts to get to 1825. . The game changes completely. . Well Dennis we know the story in the first half of the year was when yields go up it’s bad for the equity market. . That is why we saw growth stocks underperforming to such a degree. . They have staged a pretty remarkable comeback over the last month is essentially what you’re saying. . If yields are going higher from here that’s not going to last much longer. . I don’t think it last much longer. . As the chairman of the University of in that I got us to move a good 14 or 15 percent of the portfolio out. . We got very lucky we did on in December 30. . And as I’ve always said but in a bear market he or she who loses the least will be the winner. . We’ve lost less than most other endowments. . We have a meeting next week. . And I’m probably going to say we need to reduce our exposure just a tad more. . You’re going to reduce equities. . You’re going to reduce equity exposure even with this ginormous rally we’ve seen from June 16th. . Dennis at the margin probably another one or two or three percent. . Nothing dramatic nothing extraordinary. . But I think the rally has been a real bear market. . The volume has not been as illustrative or as dramatic as it should be on an EPS on a move to the upside. . And over the course of the past six months or seven months volume seems to come in on the downside rather than on the upside. . Another technical circumstance to pay attention to. . So I’m going to my position would be that I’d like to reduce our exposure just a tad weather and get the rest of the committee to agree is another story. . What do you do with it. . What do you do with the rest of it. . Buy options in the Cincinnati Reds or do you go into cash. . What do you do. . There’s a good game last night and watching the Cincinnati Reds. . But I think cash is probably not a bad place to be. . In fact I think cash is a very good place to be. . Cash being two year bonds and under two year treasuries and under Dow Jones Bill Cosby you continue to invert. . It’s been inverted for now for a month and a half. . You know it’s probably and I think the twos versus is get to it gets to 80 basis points without too much difficulty. . Dennis we’ve heard that this week. . Thank you so much. . Dennis Gartman with us from the University of Akron Endowment Fund and of course the acclaimed Gartman letter as well. . Lisa I’m glad Dennis brings that up because that’s really the salient call of the week as we’ve heard people extend out from premium miseries courageous negative 40 basis points negative 50 basis points to some ginormous inversion. . The underlying question is how much of the move that we’ve seen in markets is purely because of the decline in oil prices. . OK I go that. . I think we’ve got to work on the weekend Lisa you and I got to put together the brand of gloom cast. . I think you’re right. . You give your inputs and I’ll give mine. . You need to stay with us. . Paul Sankey will join us on oil soon. . Good morning. . To continue to hear hawkish comments from the Fed because they need to have credibility to keep inflation expectations in check. . We might be going in a better direction than people thought. . We don’t think we’re kind of in the clear. . With respect to risks not yet convinced that price pressures have peaked. . The debate on inflation has peaked. . I think that’s over. . And now it’s a debate on how fast it comes down. . This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Tom Keene Jonathan Ferro and Lisa Abramowicz What’d You Miss? sentiment kind of Friday. . Good morning. . This is at Bloomberg Surveillance for our audience worldwide live on Bloomberg Television and Radio. . Tom Keene. . John Farrell. . Lisa Abramowicz. . John. . Out. . We are so lucky to have Kailey Leinz here. . And Tom my takeaway from this week is how important gasoline prices have been to everything underpinning a lot of the rally that we’ve seen in both bonds and stocks simply said enough is about a gallon of gas. . Paul Sweeney has been very good about this is Bloomberg Surveillance on radio. . And Lisa you’re right it never can be said enough. . It seems old. . It seems dated. . We’re biased on the island of Manhattan. . Guess what. . We’re wrong. . It matters. . It matters from every point of view not only because it allows people to have more discretionary spending but that they’re not putting it toward the pump. . But also it affects things like that University of Michigan sentiment survey that we’re going to be getting at 10 a.m. . today. . It’s going to affect all of the inputs perhaps even next week with those retail sales. . Tom what are you watching for that pivot point to understand whether this rally is real. . I just I just I just don’t know. . I just think the news flow right now is extraordinary. . The reading over the weekend will be there at this hour. . We’ve got some great logos lined up just in the next 30 minutes folks. . You’ll hear from Paul Sankey on oil and the surge in natural gas. . And in moments Lisa Jeffrey you’ll join us Dani Burger. . Meanwhile Kaylee how real is this. . How much trading is this in. . You talk to people all day long about exactly this question and how many people just come out and say it is so thin right now. . It is August. . Go home go on vacation because no one’s really out there making volumes. . Yeah everything seems more dramatic in the summertime because there’s just less people at play Lisa. . But there is starting to become a sense of that is shifting that this maybe is something more substantial. . The bear market rally narrative that was persistent for so long does feel like it’s morphing as the market sees this week as something of a turning point. . But in the Federal Reserve speak we have gotten it is not clear that policymakers agree. . Mary Daly and Neel Kashkari Charlie Evans all talking about how they think they have more work to do. . The fight against inflation is not over. . The market though doesn’t seem like they believe them. . Yeah. . And Tom what do you make of this that the more the market has to rally the more there is a Fed call the more that they’re going to come out and say we’re going to raise rates more. . Just to tell you guys that I underplay that. . I think the Fed is data dependent and they’ll be working off the economic data that they see. . And you know you know I don’t play Matt Miller attention to 75 beats or 50 beats here or there. . But I do think what is germane is where the finishing point is. . Within all this pontification is a three and a half percent or an a longer Bloomberg economics is way out of the lonely foreign three quarters or 5 percent. . I’m focused on the data this morning which is a positive tone to markets finishing up a week. . And it yesterday we saw that fade into the close. . Can we retain that today as people take a look at whether or not there is this disinflationary tilt across the board you’ve got S&amp;P up about four tenths of a percent the same as NASDAQ. . You have yields just a touch lower that to your yields is coming lower although yesterday that 10 year yield Tom actually rose after the auction. . It was an interesting auction because it was not met with enthusiasm. . And this shows the really risk of pushing back against some of the moves that we’ve seen to Dennis Garments point Gartman showed the ambivalence is out there I will say and this goes to what we’re going to address with Jeff you. . It’s about flow of money you mountains earlier lease. . And I think in the weekend literature we will see it. . The wall of money moving right now is tangible. . And right now out of cash into stocks into a credit. . And you are seeing a bit of a dollar strength reasserting itself after an incredible amount of weakness. . There is somebody who tracks this incredibly well and speaks incredibly articulately on this every time we have him on. . We are incredibly lucky to have Jeff you with our senior EMEA market strategist at BBY NY Mellon. . Jeff did anything change for you this week. . Not much for us. . You know we’re still holding on to the view that the Fed needs to keep expectations for several rates. . Could be awful. . Whether the next hike is relatively firm looking at 75 percent markets need to be on guard and need to be vigilant on this. . But your earlier point about flows obviously and changes risk on two very interesting developments one in ethics markets. . People are looking for quality. . What do I mean by quality. . Surplus economies not the larger ones. . The likes of Switzerland likes of Sweden the likes of Korea Singapore with healthy sub. . Says good balance of payments lower yields on strengthening currencies. . That’s what looking at. . Secondly to your point about credit. . If we can borrow an equivalent in emerging market bonds probably on a hedged basis. . Clients are looking back as well. . Flow are showing ample buying of that. . So yes some risk on but only where it matters. . And anyway this quality Jeff quality makes me think the dollar. . Yet the dollar is what sold off yesterday. . And that classic risk I’m telling. . Do you expect the dollar to reassert its strength or do you continue to see the risk on being paired with a weaker dollar. . Well I still think the dollar is quite strong right now. . If we look at where your dollar is. . If we look at where a dollar sterling is Michael Barr dollar yen as you know even after the recent downward move that’s where the dollar is still asserting itself. . Donovan can be for example. . So whether the dollar should be asserting itself on a growth basis on an inflation and interest rates expectations basis. . Absolutely. . But it’s no longer the only game in town. . And I think that’s when money is being put to work. . Jeff for you as money moves around and repossessions and there’s a lot of heated debate is cash good asset to be an. . So cash right now is a less bad asset to be and your opportunity cost in earning cash is lower not only on a nominal basis because of high rates of both but on a risk adjusted basis as well. . So I think people are realizing the value of cash rather than that fear of missing out. . I need to be as underweight cash as possible. . So that will have implications for the structure of markets as well. . These short volatility products know what you’re trying to pick up your son yield on your paper by selling options or things like that. . Those are going to be taken off and I think that’s actually healthy for the market as well. . But over medium to longer Tom Mackenzie time horizon I think people again are putting money to work. . How do you respond to the efficacy of a two part market where quality wins persistent cash flows wins and everything else doesn’t. . And the ability to pick those stocks. . Can you get away with that. . Well not if it’s stocks or currency or a bond you really have to show your value right now. . For companies and for countries. . Show me where reform is. . Show me where your plans are. . Show me how you’re going to improve your cash flow. . Show me how you are going to be able to offset your costs of your your rising cost either through internal productivity growth or let’s take the example of Europe for example. . How can you lift your trenberth and how can you get out of a situation whereby people are fundamentally reassessing the quality and the euro. . The eurozone is running a trade deficit against non eurozone countries. . When was the last time that happened. . On a sustained basis. . So what is plan B for growth. . It’s now showing the plan is not sustainable. . It’s not going to work. . So that’s where the internal changes need to happen. . On a micro and macro level if you don’t have quality right in. . Show me a plan where you can obtain quality again. . Yeah. . Jeff I’m glad you brought up Europe because I got my electricity bill earlier this week in my ISE mildly bugged out of my head when I received it. . And yet I thought at least it could be worse instead of New York. . I could live in London or elsewhere in Europe where the energy situation is far worse. . We had a headline crossing the Bloomberg earlier about most of England being declared in drought. . We have the Rhine River that is expected later today to have such a low water level. . It becomes impassible at one critical point. . How doomed is Europe. . Well let’s start with the UK. . So 5000 pounds per year in energy bills where household disposable income is depending where you obviously 30 to 35 thousand pounds. . On top of that mortgage payments potentially increasing by 2000 3000 pounds a year. . Post-tax them by the way. . So that is problematic. . And right now does and it’s to say a lot of a lack of government rather than a lack of vision that they’re going to push things through. . Europe is not doing the same because there are stabilizers in place now. . There are a longstanding fiscal plans to help the household but it comes at a cost. . If the household is going to be protected that industry will have to suffer as a result of gas rationing for example for the chemicals industry in open Germany for the auto industry that is coming suddenly talk about the filling up to stop the inefficiency element that long wasted gentlemen earlier. . But at the same time I think fundamental changes are needed and not by fear for the eurozone is that downside scenario. . Madam Mogahed talked about where growth will contract by one point seven percent next year. . This is swiftly becoming if not already markets call case 2023. . In the eurozone. . Jeffrey thank you so much. . Really appreciate it would be NY Mellon and Lisa as we move to Jackson all here the Fed speak is going to be fascinating. . I mean you know we’re distant from that September meeting and between the Fed dialogue not so much a Jackson Hole but tangential to it like we heard from Mary Daly getting the tealeaves here not for the parlor game but just sort of the mood of the nation will be critical. . Do they see the risks still as being greater that they could pause too soon and allow a repeat of the 1970s. . Or do they see a risk of curtailing the economy more greatly and having that kind of erode the balance of errors is what I’m watching from those tealeaves anyway and translate that into the inflation path. . And you know the physics and the economics Liz it’s about inertial force. . It’s not talk so much but just the inertial force of disinflation. . And the idea that that’s a smooth curve down to 5 percent or 4 percent or dare I say down to 2 percent is just delusional. . Well the inertial force in France is not going in the right direction and the inertial force and food is not going in the right direction. . So there are inertial forces that are working against them. . And then if you get the oil price climbing how much does that really cold so-called what. . Throw some cold water over the narrative that way. . I mean we haven’t even talked about it yet. . December 14th that’s a meeting. . What if there’s a pause in this descent of inflation. . We get what do we get there. . We get one two three I think for inflation reports before December 14th. . What if we stop this inflating that’s not in the dialogue. . And what if we get an Adam Posen ask idea at Jackson Hole that they would be okay with 3 percent or that would be a bombshell. . Now you’re making some news there. . I’m not making news. . I’m just I mean evacuating the Bears. . The Bears have come out of the forest and listen. . Blizzard. . I’m not saying that come out. . It’s very. . How many others. . The pheasant Tom Keene. . I know you don’t want anything. . Late August the pheasant of Jackson Hole. . Stay tuned. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first red I’m risky Gupta. . FBI agents reportedly searched Donald Trump’s Florida home for classified documents related to nuclear weapons. . That’s according to The Washington Post. . The newspaper says people familiar with the probe didn’t say if the documents were recovered. . Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant. . The Justice Department has already asked a court for the papers to be unsealed. . Beanbags on the president. . Biden is preparing to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections. . That sets up a potential rematch with Donald Trump. . Those close to President Biden described him as upbeat about recent legislative economic and foreign policy victories. . Polls show most Democrats would rather have another candidate. . San Francisco Fed President Mary Daley says the killer inflation reading for July is welcome and she believes it may be appropriate for the Fed to slow its interest rate increase to 50 basis points next month. . Still Daley told Bloomberg TV the fight against inflation is far from over. . She says rate hikes need to be dependent on data. . Three of China’s biggest state owned companies planned to delist from U.S. . exchanges. . That fallout from a dispute over whether American regulators should be allowed to inspect audits of Chinese businesses that are listed in the US. . The three companies that will delist China like China and Sinopec the way has been cleared for Samsung vice chairman Jihye Lee to formally take the helm of the electronics conglomerate. . South Korea’s president use skill cleared the add to the country’s biggest company of bribery charges. . Lee spent 18 months in prison before his release on parole a year ago. . Going to use 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries on which you could get to. . This is Glenn Beck. . I have a baseline case going into September that is 50 basis points that’s where I’d been since the last meeting but I have an open mind about whether 75 is going to be necessary and a lot of that will depend on the labor market information and whether we start to see those things slow enough to say while we’ve got the momentum right. . Surely our most interesting president of the Federal Reserve Bank Mary Daley has an original story in San Francisco. . And of course a huge shoes to fill there. . John Williams and she is front and center on the social sensitivities of all of this economic mumbo jumbo. . We talk of futures up 19 on a Friday. . Dow futures up 126 less. . I mean call it a persistent lift. . And it’s not off of you know CPI Wednesday or whatever we’ve got here. . It’s just a nice lift in the market. . It comes from all of the reassessments that people are going to be talking about over the weekend about whether there is more disinflation than they previously thought. . One hundred dollar print number and crude earlier 97 98 now down a dollar sixty. . A wobbling of hydrocarbons this morning. . That gets us to Paul Sankey founder and lead analyst of Sankey Research with decades and decades of experience of the Michael Barr economic analysis of all this. . Paul how close is America to the many deviation leaps that we’re seeing in European hydrocarbons. . Are we dealing at or linked to those war events. . Well the good news is you know Tom is that we produce a vast amount of oil and gas here. . So ten years ago we were that’s importers of 8 million barrels a day of oil. . Believe it or not. . Now we’re net neutral. . So the U.S. . oil and gas industry has done a phenomenal job not only of oil but we’re also now the world’s largest natural gas exports. . And as you know the problem in Europe is that they really don’t produce a whole lot of domestic energy. . Full stop. . Certainly. . Right. . They stop their nuclear and coal so they get into their own problems. . So the big pull here is going to be a concern which is exports to Europe. . Whether or not that drives you think local gas prices very high ISE. . Natural gas prices very high is quite Paul Sweeney. . You can pass a barrel of oil like no one. . Let’s wander over to methane and natural gas. . When Paul Sweeney uses energy one go from two to eight. . What does that signal for you. . Probably that we’re going to send the price in Europe as you know is more like 50 or FTSE you. . I mean extraordinary prices. . So the draw there if it costs you about five six seven eight dollars to cross the Atlantic there’s obviously implicitly a massive pull on our exports. . And that’s I think going to be sufficiently large to pressure natural gas prices into Windsor. . It now becomes a question of whether we’ve got hurricane season which hasn’t really happened yet at all. . And then of course the really concerning question and it’s a major concern is how cold it gets this winter. . And if we get a globally cold winter that we’re going to have death I’m afraid. . Well that’s on the natural gas side. . And that’s a pretty dire projection on this Friday on the oil side. . The IEA saying the increasing number of gas relying electricity providers are turning to gas to oil prices to oil in order to stave off some of the shortages. . How underfunded is this market. . How cheap is this market relative to where it will be ISE the end of this year. . The U.S. . price I mean is way below that said I mean you know as I said we’re over 50 dollars per Emily Chang more or less in Europe. . And quite possibly go higher based on what Tom and I were just discussing European electricity prices. . They’ve they’re just you know they’ve gone as you said exponential essentially. . But I mean in terms of oil prices that’s where I was going with this with this idea that this is inflationary input. . Yeah. . OK. . So the oil situation is a bit different because essentially Russia makes more money from oil and continues to supply oil to the market. . So the oil crisis is not a crisis to the extent that the gas crisis is. . So there’s going to be a major pressure upwards on natural gas prices at the moment. . There is marginal use of oil which the IEA has highlighted as you said not least. . Propane for example is a direct substitute for natural gas but also generally the use of oil and coal is going to be driven by by the problems in Europe. . No question. . It’s just that the Russians really haven’t reduced the supply of oil anything like what they’ve done to the natural gas side. . Paul here in the United States later today the House is expected to pass the Inflation Reduction Act and eventually the president simply will sign it. . The measures within that some of them including the tax on methane emissions. . How do you expect that could impact the supply landscape here in the U.S.. . It’s significant. . It’s split the industry. . So the big the big oil’s the excellence of Chevron and Conoco Phillips already have very strong methane limits and continue to pursue zero flaring as a target for example. . And then you have this enormous tale of companies. . I think the six thousand U.S. . oil and gas companies of which I can only name 50. . So if at best. . So this enormous tail is under direct threat and it could be assuming that it passes and that is implemented strongly. . It will be a major pressure to the downside on marginal U.S. . gas production. . No question. . So is there a threat that the inflation reduction act at least when it comes to energy prices actually becomes more inflationary. . Yes. . All right. . Paul it Erick. . Paul I think we probably should leave it there. . Tom what do you say. . I think Paul you think you’re on short notice for joining us here today with what has been underreported in the American press. . I’m not going to mince words about it. . Natural gas sustained here. . You know I don’t use the units because they’re British thermal units. . And you know I have to wear a bathing suit or something if I quote those. . But little Lisa the fact is just looking at the measurement of natural gas off energy one different than Netherlands is two to eight. . Dennis Gartman talking about nine. . And I believe Paul he said there we would move right through to 10. . And that’s got a huge issue. . And particularly Lisa was substitution. . We’re nowhere near the coal substitution you’re seeing in Europe right now. . But you wonder is that is that a 2023 story. . Coal substitution or oil substitution. . And that’s what I was trying to get at. . You’re seeing that increasingly threatens Germany. . Thanks. . I know but go ahead. . Going forward are you going to see an increasing amount of that in the United States as well. . Kind of pushing against this push to stay a step away from the fossil fuel burning sources of energy. . Honestly I think that there’s going to have to be some sort of adjustments whether that’s going to reverse some of the gains some of the losses that we’ve seen recently in the price of oil. . We’re going to continue on here. . We’ve got another good half hour here. . Bloomberg Surveillance on to other projects. . Lisa Abramowicz getting real with a real yield today. . Drew Matus will come up is well. . But you know I got to say having Caylee here has been very beneficial. . And of course we’ve seen you make a men’s team spirit visible on television for those you in radio. . There’s an extraordinary moment yesterday where Lisa and Caylee just wanted to. . Hi I don’t know what’s in the record day hiding as a game. . I am winning. . There were the beverage of my choice on the couch last night with that bill. . And Maria Tadeo calls up from Barcelona and says my Spanish was wrong. . Are you really conjugate tomorrow. . I felt. . What is this photo about on radio. . It’s appalling. . They literally want to hide. . I mean look at the banner. . Who wouldn’t speak Spanish incorrectly about drinking in an election there. . It’s been a great week. . And we will see this I think is Bloomberg. . Good morning. . Bloomberg Surveillance on a Friday an important conversation coming up here with Drew Matus of Net Life as well. . Please help me with the day check. . Futures negative 19. . Dow Futures negative 123. . It’s auction free Friday Lisa Abramowicz. . I see positive across the board. . Actually I think everything is is doing quite nicely and constructive at NASDAQ up about five tenths of a percent. . The S&amp;P up about the same. . A little bit of a bid into treasuries. . Basically the lift is not coming off data. . It is coming off this feeling that we are not getting as fast inflation. . We have hit peak inflation and the Fed is going to respond. . I would suggest Kailey Leinz it for John Farrow. . Kelly I would suggest that what we’ve seen here today and in the last couple days is flows in a lot of doubt about the persistency of the flows in the equities. . Yeah. . And you’ve seen that in the Bank of America data that Michael Hartnett put together seven point one billion dollars in global equity funds pulled in through August 10th which of course was the CPI day eleven point seven billion dollars worth of flows into bonds as well four point three billion pulled out of cash. . Tom if you’re still in triple leverage all cash seems like you might be the only one because a lot of people have decided at this stage this week and they’re putting money to work you know based on the hate mail I get. . I would say that’s it’s right. . It’s a pretty lonely position. . Truman joins us now to sort this out. . He is chief market strategist at MetLife. . But that barely describes what he and Maury Harris stood at UBS years ago in the depths of the great financial crisis where they suggested the American economy would piece together and would be resilient and would move forward over the coming decade. . Drew I look at the moment that we’re in right now in the one statistic that gets my attention is three ratios of productivity. . People like you seem to be very concerned about a dearth of productivity and inefficiency in the economy. . Is that evident or can we prosper. . I think it’s evident you know one of the things that’s most disturbing is actually that right now you have the GDP contracting right. . And we can off the recession as much as we want. . But GDP is contracting and yet we’re still hiring a ton of people. . And so many were hiring this people because the systems become so inefficient that without all those additional people you can actually get the job done. . And if that’s the case in Europe potential growth rate is declining. . And so it’s it’s bad news for the economy. . It’s bad news for long term inflation. . And it’s it’s bad news for kind of what the next recession might look like. . What does it mean for investment. . What does it mean for the greater actuarial assumption of someone like MetLife or the actual assumption of our viewers and listeners or we’re just trying to get to Labor Day. . Well if it’s sustained it’s kind of a lower trend growth story for the United States which is obviously not something we want we want to be in a high growth environment with modest inflation. . Because that’s what actually outperforms and creates the most wealth for an economy. . And of course workers benefit if they’re productive. . All right. . And worker standard of living increases if people are productive. . If we’re not productive those things are going to decline. . And so. . You know I think from a kind of a very long term perspective it’s a negative for interest rates. . It’s a negative for growth in the U.S. . economy. . It’s negative for U.S. . competitiveness. . How long you remain gloomy Drew when you see the optimism being reflected in pretty much all of the markets. . You know I’ve got to say I’m kind of short term gloomy but long term very positive. . I think this blip in productivity is it’s just that I think it’s a situation where everyone’s trying to get used to kind of this new environment that we’re in. . And I think this new environment is actually an old environment. . We got so used to being service sector driven that we forgot that there are cycles in the economy that don’t pertain to services. . So there’s a manufacturing cycle and there’s inventory builds and inventory contractions. . And one of the things I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is. . You know. . Is everything we’re seeing really just a return to a kind of economic volatility that used to be the norm. . Let’s say before the 1990s. . So what do you bide your. . Well so that’s a great question because you know our nearer term forecast is that you know we’re not in a recession now but it’s coming and there’s going to be a calm before the storm which is kind of what we’re in right now. . And I think you know one of the one of the most important questions I think we’re trying to figure out right now is what the next recession looks like and how could it be how sustained could it be. . And more importantly then what the recovery is out of it. . So I don’t think now’s the time for caution because I do think you know what we’re seeing now is kind of a false dawn and that we’re going to get towards the end of the year we’re going to really begin to see people pull back on things like hiring and investments. . And that will affect the consumer and with the consumer will go the economy higher. . You know I thought. . I’m sorry. . Well just when you say the consumer I wonder what kind of consumer we’re really talking about because you have a company like Apple with Bloomberg reporting overnight that they’re telling suppliers make as many next generation iPhones this year as you did last year because affluent consumers are still going to be upgrading their phones. . Yet there is the lower end of the income spectrum which is struggling with higher food and gas prices. . And maybe that’s where the cutbacks on discretionary spending are coming from. . So if it’s a consumer led recession and is only actually part of the consumer base. . Well that’s always going to be the case. . Right. . I mean when we think about the consumer what moves the needle and we consumers the middle class upper middle class because through the people who are actually very their consumption they get worried about their job. . They cut back on things. . You know the very rich and the very poor don’t actually change their consumption patterns very much. . In one case because they don’t need to add in the other case because they can’t. . And so it’s that it’s that middle grouping that moves the needle. . And you know I would say that you know that middle group is looking a little bit more stressed of late. . You’re seeing a pickup in things like credit card credit. . You’re seeing them balk at higher prices for various large ticket items. . And so they are making decisions that are that are preparing them for a potential downturn. . It just hasn’t really reached the level of momentum yet. . And of course you know every time they think that they should be preparing you know you get something you get some good news on something like the labor front. . But I do think they’re becoming increasingly nervous. . Will under you talk about momentum building we’ve already seen signs of that affecting corporations like Wal-Mart and Target warning on margins because of the very for margins because of the forces you are talking about when do we start to see that margin erosion. . More broadly do you think it’s coming. . Well so I mean if you if we look at economy wide margins and when you look at economy wide margins they have peaked and are coming off. . There’s some distortion caused by things like loan forgiveness. . So you have to kind of work through that a little bit. . But it does seem like economy wide margins have peaked and have begun to erode. . And when they erode enough you begin to see large larger scale pullbacks from companies hiring and investment. . And so it gets the clock ticking towards kind of a recession. . And once again they all kind of lines up with kind of like in 2023 date whether you’re looking at things like the yield curve or whether you’re looking at things like margins Drew all the consumer. . Do we go into retail sales next week. . It’s why we’ll see. . In the sea is a big big C++ G but it’s an ex. . What does consumption do. . Well I think you’re going to continue to see the move towards services. . People spent a lot of money on goods during during the Covid crisis and they’re moving towards services and you’re seeing that’s where the demand is. . The real question is this how much or how how long is that going to hold up. . I think that the movement is going to hold. . But what’s the overall level. . And I think the overall level is going to begin to decline a little bit as people begin to balk at higher prices. . See they’ve already done that with things like cars. . And you know the question is when will they begin to do it for things like air fares hotels the service experiences that have been holding up so well. . So where do you run at MetLife. . I mean know not to get into the nuances of your portfolio but what does it mean for bond prices to see that kind of economic view. . Well you know we focus a lot on credit here right. . So the goal for us is to kind of pick the assets that you’re going to pay back for holding. . And you know some of that payback is kind of what’s the yield on it and some of it that’s what’s the credit on it. . And so it’s a time to be a little concerned a little concerned and making sure you’re paying very close attention to the credit component making sure that you’re going to get paid back for him and taking the risk that you thought you were taking. . And so you know there’s various places you can do that. . Also an inflation environment. . You know real estate tends to be a nice inflation hedge. . And in my life you know we’re fortunate enough to have an agricultural business. . Agricultural lending business which also kind of provides some of that. . Just real quick do we only have about 30 seconds. . How frustrating is it to the market. . The entire market trades risk on risk off to a lower or higher or higher oil price. . Well it’s so frustrating so much as I think that you’re seeing the market respond to a return to economic volatility which most people who are trading on Wall Street today probably haven’t seen before. . We got very used to things moving in very long trend line movements with very little volatility around it. . And I think we’re returning to a period of much more akin to the 80s where you’re going to get a lot more volatility on a quarter by quarter basis in terms of growth. . And you have to look through that and really kind of do your homework in terms of who can handle that kind of volatility as they try to plan for the future. . Terrific brief. . Drew Matus thank you so much with MetLife Investment Management this morning Lisa. . Ben Emmons has been very strong this week writing of subtle notes really thoughtful on the path to Jackson Hole. . He calls it an August euphoric overshoot. . It sounds like something you wrote Lisa. . And what I would point to as you and I have followed is a Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index which is measured in standard deviations. . And Lisa. . It’s extraordinary from the equity bottom of moving from greater than one negative standard deviation in moments ago popping through a negative point to zero to a better statistic. . I mean it’s irrefutable what these financial conditions say they are loosening which is probably not what the Fed would like to see unless they are caught and they control it. . I’m not sure that you kidding. . Well they could control it. . They come out with a 1 percent rate hike in September. . They could control it if they come out and they actually make material moves to say you guys are wrong. . Whether they actually want to do that is another question. . The economy actually is right. . We’ll continue this conversation with Matt D out of Merrill and Bank of America by the bank. . Coming up I gonna tell you this conversation. . The Jackson Hole folks look for Lisa Abramowicz as exclusive interview with Jerome Powell. . It will be surveillance NIKKEI exclusive. . This is where she just will grill the chairman. . It’s such a 1 percent. . This is. . Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word on which you can get to. . That’s a report that amongst the items FBI agents search for Donald Trump’s Florida home where classified documents related to nuclear weapons. . According to The Washington Post people familiar with the investigation didn’t say those documents were found. . Meanwhile the former president has called for the release of the search warrant. . The Justice Department has already asked for a court a court for the papers to be unsealed. . President Biden wants four more years. . Bloomberg slammed the president is set to launch his re-election campaign in the months after November’s congressional elections. . Those close to Bloomberg say he’s encouraged by recent legislative economic and foreign policy successes. . But polls show most Democrats would rather have a never candidate. . Today the Rhine River is likely to shrink to a level that could disrupt the transport of fuel throughout Europe. . The effects can ripple through the continent for months. . The water level at a key route up Key Waypoint west of Frankfurt is set to go below about 16 inches and continue dwindling. . That makes it uneconomical for barges carrying coal and oil to transit the river. . Moscow is facing pushback from retailers over a new product for customers. . It allows them to pay off their purchases in installments. . MasterCard has told merchants on their banks that it will charge retailers three percent of a purchase price each time a consumer uses the new program which is less can still can opt out by now. . PPI latest service globally is 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than twenty seven hundred journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. . And you can get to. . This is back. . Markets are completely ignoring Fed speak right now. . They don’t want to hear it. . They fighting the Fed fighting the Fed. . I think you always need to bring the big guns out. . We need Powell to come out and speak until he speaks. . I think the market rally can keep going. . See Machar there was some optimism when principal global investors taking it down too. . When the chairman speaks in Jackson Hole we’re pleased to tell you that Lisa Abramowicz Jonathan Ferro and I will be at Jackson Hole with a team. . Michael McKee will join us is well really our major contact with the Federal Reserve of Kansas City and their academic meeting. . But we hope to make it more than academic for you. . We look for that in about 15 days. . Kailey Leinz in for Jonathan Ferro. . I’m Tom Keene and thank you so much for joining us. . With futures ever so slightly. . Doing a shoot see Machar advance up 19 right now. . Make that up 20 points on the Standard and Poor’s. . Dow futures up 139. . This is the conversation of the day for every American family on radio and TV. . Overwhelmed by the cost of airfare. . Helene Becker brings good news. . Senior research analyst at COWAN. . Helene you guys do definitive work that you and Kai Rumer invented which is measuring the air fares percent change. . You detect a crack. . Is it possible airfares could collapse come the autumn and winter. . I wouldn’t say collapse but definitely come down where. . We’re already seeing them decline. . It looks like June July was the peak and we’ve seen what you call promotional fares come down after Labor Day. . They’re not as low as they were last fall. . Last fall we saw the most lowest. . Thirty nine dollars one way. . We’re seeing them. . Fifty nine dollars one way. . So they’re definitely come down and. . Right. . If fuel prices go down they’ll continue to come down. . I’m looking for the 59 dollar ticket to see DG in Paris as well past domestic versus international. . So domestic is is significantly lower. . We’re seeing fares come down in October for international September still seems to be fairly high although I’ve noticed some really good deals if you want to go to places like Paris. . Haven’t seen much in the way of London. . London seems sold out but I’ve seen Paris I’ve seen Frankfurt Madrid Barcelona on unmarked down. . So there were places that have good sales for after Labor Day as well. . I’m guessing Tom’s going to spend a couple hours later on today searching prices for and take a spare. . I mean I don’t I don’t ever listen to our interviews back Kailey Leinz Becker. . I listen back like five times. . Take check Paris. . All right. . Well Helene you were just talking about how fuel prices have come down so that will have a bearing on fares. . Are you saying essentially that it’s more about the input costs that airlines are facing that dictate that rather than it being some kind of demand construction on the part of the traveler not being willing to pay higher fares anymore. . I think it’s a combination of both. . Right. . I think that we’ve seen input costs especially fuel come down off the peak. . So that’s a good ISE that labor costs are still very high. . The Department of Transportation reported yesterday that in June the number of employees employed by airlines exceeded the number in 2019. . So we’re already back to pre pandemic levels of employment. . The fact that we’re seeing these huge delays continue just means that airports are still understaffed and whether on the East Coast is not helping. . So. . So think about it that way as far as demand goes. . We’re seeing very strong demand especially for ultra low cost airlines. . And we’re seeing what we’re calling trade down as people have relocated and they have to go back to their home office paying for tickets as gifts gets old fast. . So we’re definitely seeing trade down to the ultra low cost airlines. . And of course to your point. . Food costs are high. . Gasoline prices are high although I’ve heard they’ve come off. . The lows are the highs rather. . So maybe that makes a little more attractive for people to fly again. . Yeah but instead of taking five trips it’ll take four something like that. . But I got consumers get tired of High Flyers for sure. . Yeah. . And that definitely impacts the leisure side. . What about the business side. . Tom John and Lisa have their business class tickets booked to Jackson Hole in a couple of weeks. . Is everybody else doing that too. . Yes. . I think what we’re seeing is business travel resume. . We might not be seeing five people going to that conference. . We may only see three but we’re definitely seeing an increase in business travel. . Earlier this year we were down still down 50 to 60 percent. . Now we’re down closer to 20 and 30 percent. . And a couple of the airlines and their recent earnings calls talked about it being down 15 to 20 percent. . So you’re seeing that increase especially as return to office happens as more people go back to their offices at least two days a week. . You’re seeing that travel come back. . Elaine I talked to Lisa Abramowicz this week in Broome. . So to me she said Tom you got to watch. . Guess who’s coming to dinner just to see the opening of the movie which is a magisterial United Airlines 747 flying from another time and place. . So there I am channeling Abramowitz Spencer Tracy Katharine Hepburn and Sidney Party Day. . And it was all great. . But it’s about the image of the airline. . So you are long on someone like Kirby’s United Airlines. . Great. . The fact is USO has gone 90 to 20 and you now climb back up to 40. . Do you envision that you will yell and the others can get back to that market. . I have 90. . Probably not. . And the reason we say that is even if the earnings are what they forecast. . So back when we had our hundred dollar price target on United we were talking about them doing thirteen dollars in earnings in 2020. . And of course the pandemic interfered. . So we pushed that out to twenty twenty three or four. . But remember they issued shares during the pandemic to get through it. . And so when you add in the increase of the shares even if they get back to the net income no increase in shares outstanding means that you’re not getting back to the thirteen dollars. . Maybe you’re getting back to 12 and instead of nine multiple maybe as an eight multiple because the airlines are still losing money in a recession which if you recall that 2018 2019 timeframe people were saying oh the airlines will never lose money again and 2020 prove how wrong that that forecast was. . You know you’re dead on about you know Newark to Paris United Airlines. . Kirby’s got it on sale this week. . That was a nine thousand dollar ticket. . And I’m seeing a quote in October for four thousand six hundred eighty three. . That’s a while. . Change isn’t it. . Yes. . Yes it is significantly lower. . And well no I get it. . October is not a time when a lot of people travel. . It’s more business time. . Yes it is. . But yeah I mean so it can settle. . So I’ll leave. . You’ll join us in Paris with Caylee in a surveillance road trip. . Tickets are on you Tom. . Okay. . Thank you. . Hello Becker. . Thank you so much for planning the next surveillance junket. . As they say she is with Cohen and definitive on travel. . Good NIKKEI. . I’m sorry. . That’s gotta be good news from the shock of what we’ve been paying. . Yeah I think we’ve gotten a lot of good news maybe this week Tom and that it has been cooler inflation. . Good news is good news again for the equity market depending on how today NASDAQ. . One hundred could be up for a fourth straight week. . Well I’m not going to give my opinion here. . You know I could I could pop. . I mean Paul Sweeney wants me to do a fractional buy on the Friday opening but I don’t think I’ve got the courage to pull them. . I just want to attach to the cash like that attached to the Kailey Leinz. . Thank you for your support this week. . It’s been a really really valuable as well. . Futures advance up 21. . Stay with us. . This is Bloomberg. .",

Implicit Feedback으로 추천 알고리즘을 다루는 논문 | Matrix Factorization과 (adaptive) k-nearest-neighbor (kNN)으로 personalized ranking 실험 | Bayesian을 활용한 최적화 기법(BPR-Opt)을 제시 | 위의 최적화 기법을 적용하여 기존의 MF, kNN 보다 더 우수한 성능을 증명 | .

Introduction &amp; Related Work . 추천 시스템을 구현하기 위해 2가지 형태가 일반적; Explicit과 Implicit 데이터 | 보통 Implicit 데이터가 더 많은 비중을 차지하고, 더 어려운 문제 | Implicit 데이터로 User의 선호도 또는 취향을 파악해야 함 | Implicit feedback으로 ranking을 추천할 수 있는 알고리즘을 제시 | 저자가 정의한 ranking을 추천하기 위한 Optimization 알고리즘 item $i$와 $j$가 있고, item $i$보다 item $j$를 더 선호 함 &rarr; $item ;i &gt; item ;j$ | 이 때, 학습할 파라미터를 최적화하는 것이 목적 | . | . Personalized Ranking . Personalized Ranking이란 User에게 ranked list of items를 제안(또는 추천) 하는 것 | Item Recommendation이라고도 함 | 본 논문은 Implicit Feedback으로 user의 취향을 고려 | implicit feedback은 주로 positive feedback이 대부분 | Non-observed Item을 다루는 것이 중요한 포인트Non-observed Item = real negative feedback + missing values . | . Formalization . $U$는 모든 users의 집합, $I$는 모든 items의 집합 | 이 때, 각 user별 personalized total ranking(${&gt;}_{u} subset I^2$)를 구하는 것 | ${&gt;}_{u}$는 다음과 같은 특성을 지님$ forall i, j in I :i neq j Rightarrow i , {&gt;}_{u} , j lor j , {&gt;}_{u} , i quad (totality)$ &gt; $ forall i, j in I :i , {&gt;}_{u} , j land j , {&gt;}_{u} , i Rightarrow i = j quad (antisymmetry)$ &gt; $ forall i, j, k in I :i , {&gt;}_{u} , j land j , {&gt;}_{u} , k Rightarrow i , {&gt;}_{u} , k quad (transitivity)$ . | . . 기존에 많이 사용하던 데이터 처리 방법 | ? 는 관측되지 않은 데이터, + 는 관측된 데이터 | 0 은 관측되지 않은 데이터 = 선호하지 않음 | 1 은 관측된 데이터 = 선호함 | Implicit data를 다루는 중요한 문제점이 있음 | . . &#51200;&#51088;&#44032; &#51228;&#50504;&#54616;&#45716; &#48169;&#48277; . 전체 데이터를 pairwise preference $i {&gt;}_{u} i$로 나타냄 | + 는 user가 $item , j$에 비해 $item , i$를 선호 | - 는 user가 $item , i$에 비해 $item , j$를 선호 | User가 보지 못한 $item , j$에 비해 관측한 $item , i$를 더 선호한다고 가정 | 유저가 $(i, j)$ 모두 관측했거나, 관측하지 않았다면 어떤 선호도도 추론할 수 없음$ {D}_{s} := {(u, i, j) , | , i in {I}_{u}^{+} land j in I setminus {I}_{u}^{+} }$ . | User u는 $item , j$ 보다 $item , i$를 더 선호 | ${&gt;}_{u}$는 antisymmetric이기 때문에 negative는 implicit이라고 가정 | . &#51200;&#51088;&#44032; &#51228;&#50504;&#54616;&#45716; &#48169;&#48277;&#51032; &#51109;&#51216; . 학습셋 ${D}_{s}$은 positive, negative, missing value로 구성 | 아이템쌍 $(i, j)$에서 관측되지 않은 결측값은 테스트셋 | 학습셋과 테스트셋은 disjoint | 학습셋은 실제 랭킹 목적에 맞게 만들어짐 | 관측된 데이터의 부분집합인 ${D}_{s}$을 학습 데이터로 사용 | . Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) . 주어진 학습 데이터 ${D}_{s}$로 Bayesian Personalized Ranking 구하는 방법을 설명 | $p(i , {&gt;}_{u} , j | Theta )$에 대한 likelihood function 과 model parameter $p( Theta)$에 대한 prior probability를 사용한 베이지안 문제로 볼 수 있음 | 다음과 같은 순서로 selection 구성 4.1 BPR Optimization Criterion 4.1.1 Analogies to AUC optimization | . | 4.2 BPR Learning Algorithm | 4.3 Learning models with BPR 4.3.1 Matrix Factorization | 4.3.2 Adaptive K-Nearest Neighbor | . | . | . BPR Optimization Criterion . Totality와 Antisymmetry에 따라 다음과 같이 정리할 수 있음 | . $$ { Large P( Theta | , {&gt;}_{u}) propto p({&gt;}_{u} | , Theta)p( Theta)} $$ . $ displaystyle prod_{u in U} p({&gt;}_{u} | , Theta) = displaystyle prod_{(u,i,j) in U times I times J)}{p(i , {&gt;}_{u} , j | , Theta )}^{ delta((u,i,j) in {D}_{s})} cdot {(1 - p(i , {&gt;}_{u} , j| Theta))}^{ delta((u,i,j) notin {D}_{s}} $ . 이 때, $ delta$ 는 $ delta(b) := begin{cases} 1, &amp; mbox{if b is true} 0, &amp; mbox{else} end{cases} $ . $ displaystyle prod_{u in U} p(&gt;_{u} , | Theta) = displaystyle prod_{u,i,j in D_{s}} p(i , &gt;_{u} , j| Theta)$ . $$ { Large p(i , &gt;_{u} , j| Theta) := sigma( widehat{x_{uij}}( Theta))} $$ $ widehat{x_{uij}}( Theta)$는 $user , u$와 $item , i, j$의 관계를 나타내는 모델 파라미터 벡터의 실제 함수 . 즉, $ widehat{x_{uij}}( Theta)$를 추정하면서 $u,i,j$ 사이의 관계를 모델링 | 전체 순서를 모델링하는 것이 비교적 간단해 짐 | . $$ Large { p( Theta | , &gt;_{u} ) propto p(&gt;_{u} | Theta)p( Theta) } $$ 사전확률분포 $p( Theta) sim N(0, Sigma_{ Theta})$로 나타내고, $ Sigma_{ Theta} = lambda_{ Theta}I$로 정함 | Likelihood와 prior 모두 정의했으므로, posterior를 공식에 따라 구할 수 있음 | . . 미분가능하기 때문에 gradient descent로 optimization 함 | SGD가 적절한 선택지가 아니기 때문에 LEARN-BPR을 제안 Triples를 학습하는 Bootstrap 기반 Stochatic Gradient-descent 알고리즘 | . | 랜덤하게 triples를 선택하는 SGD 알고리즘을 사용 동일한 쌍의 데이터 선택할 확률이 적음 | 데이터 전수가 아닌 bootstrap sampling만 해도 데이터가 많기 때문에 충분 | . | . Matrix Factorization | . . Adaptive k-Nearest Neighbor | . . LearnBPR 최적화를 위해 모든 모델 파라미터 $ Theta$에 대한 $ widehat{x_{uij}}$ 의 gradient를 알면 됨 | . Evaluation . . Conclusion . 사후확률을 최대화하려는 베이지안에 의한 새로운 방법을 제안 | Personalized Ranking을 위한 optimization 기법(BPR-OPT)을 제안 | Bootstrap Sampling을 통한 Stochastic Gradient Descent를 사용하여 모델 파라미터를 업데이트 함 | 기존 Matrix Factorization, k-Nearest Neighbor 모두 적용했으며 성능이 우수 | .",

MySQL Replication 특징 . 비동기식 (Asynchronous Replication) | 1개의 Master와 n개의 Slave로 구성되어 있음 | Master에서만 읽기 / 쓰기를 수행할 수 있음 | Master / Slave 데이터 동기화 시간차가 있음 (쓰기가 발생하면 순차적으로 한대씩 각 DB로 복제 진행) | 장애 복구시 노드간 유실되는 트랜잭션 있음 | 읽기만 확장 용이함 (쓰기 확장시 난점이 있음) | Master 장애시 매우 크리티컬한 장애 발생 (복구 장기간 소요, 데이터 유실 위험 높음) | 부분 장애시 장애 노드만 장애 발생 | 장애 요인 제거 후 단기간 / 순차적 정상화 | MySQL의 부하 분산과 효율을 최우선으로 하는 경우 유리 | . 1) Master 역할 . 웹서버로 부터 데이터 등록 / 수정 / 삭제 요청시 바이너리 로그 (Binary log)를 생성하여 Slave 서버로 전달함 | 웹서버로부터 요청한 데이터 등록 / 수정 / 삭제 기능을 하는 DBMS로 사용 | . 2) Slave 역할 . Master DBMS로부터 전달받은 바이너리 로그 (Binary log)를 데이터로 반영 | 웹서버로부터 요청을 통해 데이터를 불러오는 DBMS로 사용 | . 3) MySQL Replication 주의사항 . 호환성을 위해 Replication을 사용하는 MySQL의 버전을 동일하게 맞추는 것이 좋음 | MySQL 버전이 다른 경우 반드시 Slave 서버가 상위버전이어야 함 | Replication을 가동시에 Master, Slave 순으로 가동시켜야 함 | . 2. XtraBackup . Percona에서 개발한 오픈소스 MySQL 백업도구 | mysqldump가 테이블 생성, 데이터 쿼리에 대한 SQL 생성문을 갖는 논리적 백업이라면, XtraBackup은 엔진 데이터를 그대로 복사하는 물리적 백업 방식 | XtraBackup의 백업 방식은 크게 전체 백업, 증분 백업, 개별(db, table) 백업, Encrypted 백업 방식이 있음 | . 1) mysqldump vs XtraBackup . 2) xtrabackup vs innobackupex . XtraBackup에서 innobackupex는 2.2 next major 부터 삭제된다고 명시 | 실제로는 XtraBackup 2.4 버전까지는 유지되며 8 버전부터 삭제됨 | 실무에서 주로 사용하는 MySQL 5.6 ~5.7 버전은 XtraBackup 2.0~2.4 버전에서 호환되기에 여기서는 innobackupex 방식 사용 | XtraBackup 8 버전은 MySQL 8 버전부터 호환됨 | . 3) 전체 백업 . 장애 시 복구 과정을 단순하게 하기 위해 증분 백업을 사용하지 않고 전체 백업을 사용함 | 백업하는 동안에 table lock을 걸지 않으려면 –no-lock 옵션을 추가해야 함 | 단, InnoDB table이 아닌 경우에는 일관성 없는 백업 결과가 나올 수 있음 | 지정한 백업 경로에 테이블, 리두로그, XtraBackup 관련 테이터들이 함께 백업 | . 3. 사전 환경설정 . 1) Dependency .

RK**는 대한민국의 공항을 뜻하는 국가 코드이다. 일본은 RJ**. 독도에도 우체통이 있다. 이 우체통에 투함된 우편물은 2개월에 한 번 독도경비대함이 들어올 때 집배원이 수거한다. 서울 영등포구 기준으로 독도에서 투함한 우편물이 오는 경로는 독도⇨울릉우체국⇨포항우편집중국⇨대전교환센터⇨서서울우편집중국⇨영등포우체국⇨배달이다. 우편번호는 개정 전 6자리 번호가 799-805, 2015년 개정 후 5자리 번호는 40240이다. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap&#39;s JavaScript plugins) --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- Include all compiled plugins (below), or include individual files as needed --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; .

/&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;17세기 일본 돗토리번(鳥取藩)의 오야(大谷) 및 무라카와(村川) 양가는 조선 영토인 울릉도에서 불법 어로행위를 하다가 1693년 울릉도에서 &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick=&quot;goto_page(&#39;0020105&#39;)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;안용복&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;을 비롯한 조선인들과 만나게 되었습니다. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;양가는 일본 정부(에도 막부)에 조선인들의 울릉도 도해(渡海)를 금지해달라고 청원하였고, 막부가 &lt;span class=&quot;let02&quot;&gt;쓰시마번(對馬藩)에&lt;/span&gt; 조선 정부와의 교섭을 지시함에 따라 양국간 교섭이 개시되는데, 이를 ‘울릉도쟁계’라 합니다.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;에도 막부는 1695년 12월 25일 돗토리번에 대한 조회를 통해 “울릉도(죽도)와 독도(송도) 모두 돗토리번에 속하지 않는다”는 사실을 확인한 후(&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick=&quot;goto_page(&#39;0020104&#39;)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;「돗토리번 답변서」&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), 1696년 1월 28일 일본인들의 울릉도 방면 도해를 금지하도록 지시하였습니다. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;이로써 한&amp;#183;일 양국간 분쟁은 마무리되었고, 울릉도쟁계 과정에서 &lt;span class=&quot;let02&quot;&gt;울릉도와 독도가 우리나라 영토임이 확인되었습니다.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;imgs/txt_0302.gif&quot; alt=&quot;나. 1905년 시마네현 고시에 의한 독도 편입 시도 이전까지 일본 정부는 독도가 자국 영토가 아니라는 인식을 유지하고 있었으며, 이는 1877년『태정관지령』을 비롯한 일본 정부의 공식 문서를 통해 확인됩니다.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;list&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;한 &amp;#183; 일간 ‘울릉도쟁계’를 통해 독도가 한국 영토임이 확인된 이래, 근대 메이지 정부에 이르기까지 일본 정부는 독도가 자국 영토가 아니라는 인식을 유지하고 있었습니다. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;이는 1905년 시마네현 고시에 의한 일본의 독도 편입 시도 이전까지 독도가 일본 영토라고 기록한 일본 정부의 문헌이 없고, 오히려 일본 정부의 공식 문서들이 독도가 일본의 영토가 아니라고 명백히 기록하고 있는 사실을 통해 잘 알 수 있습니다.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;대표적으로, 1877년 메이지 시대 일본의 최고행정기관이었던 태정관(太政官)은 에도 막부와 조선 정부간 교섭(울릉도쟁계) 결과 울릉도와 독도가 일본 소속이 아님이 확인되었다고 판단하고, &lt;span class=&quot;let02&quot;&gt;“죽도(울릉도) 외 일도(一嶋: 독도)는 일&lt;/span&gt;본과 관계가 없다는 것을 명심할 것을 내무성에 지시하였습니다. &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;

            "content": "출처: https://blrunner.tistory.com/99 . 코디네이터 . Zookeeper(http://zookeeper.apache.org) . 분산 환경에서 서버 간의 상호 조정이 필요한 다양한 서비스를 제공하는 시스템으로, 크게 다음과 같은 네 가지 역할을 수행합니다. 첫째, 하나의 서버에만 서비스가 집중되지 않게 서비스를 알맞게 분산해 동시에 처리하게 해줍니다. 둘째, 하나의 서버에서 처리한 결과를 다른 서버와도 동기화해서 데이터의 안정성을 보장합니다. 셋째, 운영(active) 서버에 문제가 발생해서 서비스를 제공할 수 없을 경우, 다른 대기 중인 서버를 운영 서버로 바꿔서 서비스가 중지 없이 제공되게 합니다. 넷째, 분산 환경을 구성하는 서버의 환경설정을 통합적으로 관리합니다. . 리소스 관리 . YARN(http://hadoop.apache.org) . 얀(YARN)은 데이터 처리 작업을 실행하기 위한 클러스터 자원(CPU, 메모리, 디스크등)과 스케쥴링을 위한 프레임워크입니다. 기존 하둡의 데이터 처리 프레임워크인 맵리듀스의 단점을 극복하기 위해서 시작된 프로젝트이며, 하둡2.0부터 이용이 가능합니다. 맵리듀스, 하이브, 임팔라, 타조, 스파크 등 다양한 애플리케이션들은 얀에서 리소스를 할당받아서, 작업을 실행하게 됩니다. 얀에 대한 자세한 설명은 http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/index.html을 참고하시기 바랍니다. . Mesos(http://mesos.apache.org) . 메소스(Mesos)는 클라우드 인프라스트럭처 및 컴퓨팅 엔진의 다양한 자원(CPU, 메모리, 디스크)을 통합적으로 관리할 수 있도록 만든 자원 관리 프로젝트입니다. 메소스는 2009년 버클리 대학에서 Nexus 라는 이름으로 시작된 프로젝트이며, 2011년 메소스라는 이름으로 변경됐으며, 현재는 아파치 탑레벨 프로젝트로 진행중이며, 페이스북, 에어비엔비, 트위터, 이베이 등 다양한 글로벌 기업들이 메소스로 클러스터 자원을 관리하고 있습니다. 메소스는 클러스터링 환경에서 동적으로 자원을 할당하고 격리해주는 매커니즘을 제공하며, 이를 통해 분산 환경에서 작업 실행을 최적화시킬 수 있습니다. 1만대 이상의 노드에도 대응이 가능하며, 웹 기반의 UI, 자바, C++, 파이썬 API를 제공합니다. 하둡, 스파크(Spark), 스톰(Storm), 엘라스틱 서치(Elastic Search), 카산드라(Cassandra), 젠킨스(Jenkins) 등 다양한 애플리케이션을 메소스에서 실행할 수 있습니다. . 데이터 저장 . HBase(http://hbase.apache.org) . H베이스(HBase)는 HDFS 기반의 칼럼 기반 데이터베이스입니다. 구글의 빅테이블(BigTable) 논문을 기반으로 개발됐습니다. 실시간 랜덤 조회 및 업데이트가 가능하며, 각 프로세스는 개인의 데이터를 비동기적으로 업데이트할 수 있습니다. 단, 맵리듀스는 일괄 처리 방식으로 수행됩니다. 트위터, 야후!, 어도비 같은 해외 업체에서 사용하고 있으며, 국내에서는 2012년 네이버가 모바일 메신저인 라인에 HBase를 적용한 시스템 아키텍처를 발표했습니다. . Kudu(http://getkudu.io) . 쿠두(Kudu)는 컬럼 기반의 스토리지로서, 특정 컬럼에 대한 데이터 읽기를 고속화할 수 있습니다. 물론 기존에도 HDFS에서도 파케이(Parquet), RC, ORC와 같은 파일 포맷을 사용하면 컬럼 기반으로 데이터를 저장할 수 있지만, HDFS 자체가 온라인 데이터 처리에 적합하지 않다는 약점이 있었습니다. 그리고 HDFS 기반으로 온라인 처리가 가능한 H베이스의 경우, 데이터 분석 처리가 느리다는 단점이 있었습니다. 쿠두는 이러한 문제점들을 보완하여 개발한 컬럼 기반 스토리지이며, 데이터의 발생부터 분석까지의 시간을 단축시킬 수 있습니다. 클라우데라에서 시작된 프로젝트이며, 2015년말 아파치 재단의 인큐베이션 프로젝트로 선정됐습니다. . 데이터 수집 . Chukwa(http://chukwa.apache.org) . 척와(Chuckwa)는 분산 환경에서 생성되는 데이터를 HDFS에 안정적으로 저장하는 플랫폼입니다. 분산된 각 서버에서 에이전트(agent)를 실행하고, 콜렉터(collector)가 에이전트로부터 데이터를 받아 HDFS에 저장합니다. 콜렉터는 100개의 에이전트당 하나씩 구동되며, 데이터 중복 제거 등의 작업은 맵리듀스로 처리합니다. 야후!에서 개발했으며, 아파치 오픈소스 프로젝트로 공개돼 있습니다. . Flume(http://flume.apache.org) . 플럼(Flume)은 척와처럼 분산된 서버에 에이전트가 설치되고, 에이전트로부터 데이터를 전달받는 콜랙터로 구성됩니다. 차이점은 전체 데이터의 흐름을 관리하는 마스터 서버가 있어서 데이터를 어디서 수집하고, 어떤 방식으로 전송하고, 어디에 저장할지를 동적으로 변경할 수 있습니다. 클라우데라에서 개발했으며, 아파치 오픈소스 프로젝트로 공개돼 있습니다. . Scribe(https://github.com/facebook/scribe) . 페이스북에서 개발한 데이터 수집 플랫폼이며, Chukwa와는 다르게 데이터를 중앙 집중 서버로 전송하는 방식입니다. 최종 데이터는 HDFS 외에 다양한 저장소를 활용할 수 있으며, 설치와 구성이 쉽게 다양한 프로그램 언어를 지원합니다. HDFS에 저장하려면 JNI(Java Native Interface)를 이용해야 합니다. . Sqoop(http://sqoop.apache.org) . 스쿱(Sqoop)은 대용량 데이터 전송 솔루션이며, 2012년 4월에 아파치의 최상위 프로젝트로 승격됐습니다. Sqoop은 HDFS, RDBMS, DW, NoSQL 등 다양한 저장소에 대용량 데이터를 신속하게 전송하는 방법을 제공합니다. 오라클, MS-SQL, DB2 등과 같은 상용 RDBMS와 MySQL, 포스트그레스큐엘(PostgreSQL)과 같은 오픈소스 RDBMS 등을 지원합니다. . Hiho(https://github.com/sonalgoyal/hiho) . 스쿱과 같은 대용량 데이터 전송 솔루션이며, 현재 깃헙(GitHub)에 공개돼 있습니다. 하둡에서 데이터를 가져오기 위한 SQL을 지정할 수 있으며, JDBC 인터페이스를 지원합니다. 현재는 오라클과 MySQL의 데이터 전송만 지원합니다. . Kafka(http://kafka.apache.org) . 카프카(Kafka)는 데이터 스트림을 실시간으로 관리하기 위한 분산 메세징 시스템입니다. 2011년 링크드인에서 자사의 대용량 이벤트처리를 위해 개발됐으며, 2012년 아파치 탑레벨 프로젝트가 됐습니다. 발행(publish)-구독(subscribe) 모델로 구성되어 있으며, 데이터 손실을 막기 위하여 디스크에 데이터를 저장합니다. 파티셔닝을 지원하기 때문에 다수의 카프카 서버에서 메세지를 분산 처리할 수 있으며, 시스템 안정성을 위하여 로드밸런싱과 내고장성(Fault Tolerant)를 보장합니다. 다수의 글로벌 기업들이 카프카를 사용하고 있으며, 그중 링크드인은 하루에 1조1천억건 이상의 메세지를 카프카에서 처리하고 있습니다. . 데이터 처리 . Pig(http://pig.apache.org) . 피그(Pig)는 야후에서 개발됐으나 현재는 아파치 프로젝트에 속한 프로젝트로서, 복잡한 맵리듀스 프로그래밍을 대체할 피그 라틴(Pig Latin)이라는 자체 언어를 제공합니다. 맵리듀스 API를 매우 단순화한 형태이고 SQL과 유사한 형태로 설계됐습니다. SQL과 유사하기만 할 뿐, 기존 SQL 지식을 활용하기가 어려운 편입니다. . Mahout(http://mahout.apache.org) . 머하웃(Mahout)은 하둡 기반으로 데이터 마이닝 알고리즘을 구현한 오픈소스 프로젝트입니다. 현재 분류(classification), 클러스터링(clustering), 추천 및 협업 필터링(Recommenders/collaborative filtering), 패턴 마이닝(Pattern Mining), 회귀 분석(Regression), 차원 리덕션(Dimension reduction), 진화 알고리즘(Evolutionary Algorithms) 등 중요 알고리즘을 지원합니다. Mahout을 그대로 사용할 수도 있지만 각 비즈니스 환경에 맞게 최적화해서 사용하는 경우가 많습니다. .

(1) Document . 문서는 키와 값의 쌍으로 이루어진 집합 | 키는 중복할 수 없는 문자열이며 데이터형과 대소문자를 구분 | {name: ‘홍길동’, age: 25, groups: [‘hippop’, ‘java’]} | 문서 크기는 최대 16MB (더 큰 용량의 문서를 저장하려면 GridFS API 이용) | . (2) Collection . 컬렉션(Collection)은 문서(Document)의 모음이다. | 문서가 관계형 DB의 행을 의미하고, 컬랙션은 테이블을 의미한다. | 컬렉션은 스키마가 없기에 높은 유연성을 제공한다. (단 제약조건(Constraint)는 응용프로그램에서 지원해야 함) | . (3) Database . 문서의 모음이 컬렉션이고, 여러 컬렉션의 모음이 데이터베이스이다. | 각 데이터베이스는 따로 분리된 파일로 디스크에 저장된다. | . (4) 용어 비교 . SQL MongoDB . 데이터베이스 | 데이터베이스 | . 테이블 | 컬렉션 | . 행 | 문서 (BSON) | . 열 | 필드 | . 테이블 조인 | 내장 문서와 Linking | . 인덱스 | 인덱스 | . [참고] 문서 지향 데이터베이스의 특징 . 확장성: RDBMS는 고성능 컴퓨터를 교체로 수직적인 확장을 고려하는데 반해, 문서 지향 데이터베이스는 슈퍼 컴퓨터가 아나더라도 여려 개의 컴퓨터로 수평확장 통해 클라우드 환경에 적합하다. | 키-값 구조: 정해진 스키마 없이 키-값 구조인 Json 형식으로 저장공간을 저장하여 자유롭게 기존 문서에 추가가 가능하다. | . 기본적인 CRUD . 1) db.collectionName.insert({입력할 문서}) 2) db.collectionName.find({쿼리조건}) 3) db.collectionName.update(쿼리조건, 치환할 문서, 옵션) [옵션] - update: true / flase 조건에 일치하는 문서가 없으면 새로 입력 - multi: true / false 조건에 일치하는 모든 문서에 대해 갱신 4) db.collectionName.remove({삭제할 조건}) .

POINT 2. 옵티마이저 종류 . 1. 옵티마이저의 실행 방법 . 개발자가 SQL을 실행하면 파싱(Parsing)을 실행해서 SQL의 문법 검사 및 구문분석을 수행함 | 구문분석을 완료하면 옵티마이저가 규칙 기반 혹은 비용 기반으로 실행계획으로 수립 | 옵티마이저는 기본적으로 비용 기반 옵티마이저를 사용해서 실행계획을 수립, 비용 기반 옵티마이저는 통계정보를 활용해서 최적의 실행계획을 수립하는 것 | 실행계획 수립이 완료되면 최종적으로 SQL을 실행하고 실행이 완료되면 데이터를 인출(Fetch)함 | . 옵티마이저 엔진 . Query Transformer : SQL문을 효율적으로 실행하기 위해서 옵티마이저가 변환, SQL이 변환되어도 그 결과는 동일 | Estimator : 통계정보를 사용해서 SQL 실행비용을 계산, 총비용 최적의 실행계획을 수립하기 위해서임 | Plan Generator : SQL문을 실행할 실행계획을 수립 | . 2. 옵티마이저 엔진 . 규칙기반 옵티마이저(Ruel base Optimizer)는 실행계획을 수립할 때 15개의 우선순위를 기준으로 실행계획을 수립 | 최신 Oracle 버전은 규칙기만 옵티마이저 보다 비용기반 옵티마이저를 기본적으로 사용 | . 규칙기반 옵티마이저 엔진 우선순위 . 1 : ROWID를 사용한 단일 행일 경우 | 2 : 클러스터 조인에 의한 단일 행인 경우 | 3 : 유일하거나 기본키(Primary key)를 가진 해시 클러스터 키에 의한 단일 행인 경우 | 4 : 유일하거나 기본키(Primary key)에 의한 단일 행인 경우 | 5 : 클러스터 조인인 경우 | 6 : 해시 클러스터 조인인 경우 | 7 : 인덱스 클러스터 조인인 경우 | 8 : 복합 칼럼 인덱스인 경우 | 9 : 단일 칼럼 인덱스인 경우 | 10 : 인덱스가 구성된 칼럼에서 제한된 범위를 검색하는 경우 | 11 : 인덱스가 구성된 칼럼에서 무제한 범위를 검색하는 경우 | 12 : 정렬-병합(Sort Merge) 조인인 경우 | 13 : 인덱스가 구성된 칼럼에서 MAX 혹은 MIN을 구하는 경우 | 14 : 인덱스가 구성된 칼럼에서 ORDER BY를 실행하는 경우 | 15 : 전체 테이블을 스캔(FULL TALBE SCAN)하는 경우 . | 규칙 기반 옵티마이저에서 우선순위 1위인 ROWID를 사용한 조회를 확인해 보면 다음과 같음 | . -- 규칙기반 옵티마이저를 사용하도록 힌트를 사용 SELECT /*+ RULE */ * FROM EMP WHERE ROWID=&#39;AAAHYhAABAAALNJAAN&#39;; -- 실행계획을 확인해보면 ROWID로 EMP 테이블을 조회 . 위의 SQL문은 ‘/+RULE/’를 사용해서 옵티마이저에서 규칙 기반 옵티마이저로 실행하도록 알려줌, 이렇게 옵티마이저에서 실행방법을 알려주는 것이 힌트(HINT) | 실행계획을 확인한 결과 EMP 테이블을 ROWID로 조회 | . 3. 비용 기반 옵티마이저 . 비용 기반 옵티마이저(Cost base Optimizer)는 오브젝트 통계 및 시스템 통계를 사용해서 총 비용을 계산 | 총비용이 적은 쪽으로 실행계획을 수립, 단, 비용 기반 옵티마이저에서 통계정보가 부적절한 경우 성능 저하가 발생할 수 있음 | 총비용이라는 것은 SQL문을 실행하기 위해서 예상되는 소요시간 혹은 자원의 사용량을 의미 | . POINT 3. 인덱스(Index) . 1. 인덱스(Index) . 인덱스는 데이터를 빠르게 검색할 수 있는 방법을 제공함 | 인덱스는 인덱스 키(예: EMPNO)로 정렬(SORT)되어 있기 때문에 원하는 데이터를 빠르게 조회 | 인덱스는 오름차순(ASCENDING) 및 내림차순(DESCENDING) 탐색이 가능 | 하나의 테이블에 여러 개의 인덱스를 생성할 수 있고 하나의 인덱스는 여러 개의 칼럼으로 구성될 수 있음 | 테이블을 생성할 떄 기본키(Primary Key)는 자동으로 인덱스가 만들어지고 인덱스의 이름은 SYSXXXX임 . | 인덱스의 구조는 Root Block, Branch Block, Leaf Block으로 구성되고 Root Block은 인덱스 트리에서 가장 상위에 있는 노드를 의미하며 Branch Block은 다음 단계의 주소를 가지고 있는 포인터(Pointer) | Leaf Block은 인덱스 키와 ROWID로 구성되고 인덱스 키는 정렬되어서 저장되어 있음 . | leaf Block은 Double linked list 형태로 되어 있어서 양방향 탐색이 가능 | leaf Block에서 인덱스 키를 읽으면 ROWID를 사용해서 EMP 테이블의 행을 직접 읽을 수 있음 | . 2. 인덱스 생성 . 인덱스 생성은 ‘CREATE INDEX’문을 사용해서 생성이 가능 | 인덱스를 생성할 때는 한 개 이상의 칼럼을 사용해서 생성할 수 있음 | 인덱스 키는 기본적으로 오름차순으로 정렬되고 ‘DESC’ 구를 포함하면 내림차순으로 정렬함 | . CREATE INDEX IND EMP ON EMP (ENAME ASC, SAL DESC); . 위의 예는 ENAME에 대해서 오름차순으로 정렬하고 SAL은 내림차순으로 정렬하는 인덱스를 생성, 여기서 ENAME에 ‘ASC’ 구는 생략이 가능 | . 3. 인덱스 스캔(Index Scan) . (1) 인덱스 유일 스캔(Index Unique SCAN) . Unique Index SCAN은 인덱스 키 값이 중복되지 않는 경우, 해당 인덱스를 사용할 때 발생 | 예를 들어 EMPNO(사원번호)가 중복되지 않는 경우 특정 하나의 EMPNO를 조회 | . -- EMPNO가 1000번인 것을 조회 -- EMPNO는 중복되지 않으므로 INDEX UNIQUE SCAN이 발생 SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO=1000; . (2) 인덱스 범위 스캔(Index Range SCAN) . Index Range SCAN는 SELECT 문에서 특정 범위를 조회하는 WHERE문을 사용할 경우 발생 | 예를 들어 Like, Between이 대표적, 물론 데이터 양이 적은 경우에는 인덱스 자체를 실행하지 않고 TABLE FULL SCAN이 될 수 있음 | Index Range SCAN은 인덱스의 Leaf Block의 특정 범위를 스캔한 것 | . SELECT EMPTNO FROM EMP WHERE EMPNO &gt;= 1000; -- INDEX RANGE SCAN은 인덱스의 특정 범위를 스탬한 것을 의미함 . (3) 인덱스 전체 스캔(Index Full SCAN) . Index Full SCAN은 인덱스에서 검색되는 인덱스 키가 많은 경우에 Leaf Block의 처음부터 끝까지 전체를 읽어 들임 | . SELECT ENAME, SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME Like &#39;%&#39; AND SAL &gt;0; -- INDEX FULL SCAN은 인덱스의 Leaf Block을 처음부터 끝까지 모두 스캔한 것 . Table Full Scan 시에 High Water mark의 의미 .

            "content": "빅데이터 분석의 시초 . 빅데이터? . 빅데이터란 기존 데이터베이스 관리도구의 능력을 넘어서는 대량의 정형 또는 심지어 데이터베이스 형태가 아닌 비정형의 데이터 집합조차 포함한 데이터로부터 가치를 추출하고 결과를 분석하는 기술이다 . SQL 기반의 데이터베이스 | 주로 컴퓨터 1대에서 돌아감, 고성능이 필요하면 좋은(비싼 컴퓨터) 필요 | 대량 : 컴퓨터 1대로 처리할 수 없는 양(수십 TB 이상) | 3V (by IBM) : Volume, Velocity, Variety . | 기술 - 컴퓨터 1대로 처리하지 못하므로, 여러대를 연결해서 데이터를 저장하고 처리하자. | 주로 구글 등 검색엔진 회사들이 웹 전체를 저장하고 처리하려다보니 기술 개발이 필요하게 됨 | 구글이 이끌고, 야후 등이 오픈소스를 통해 (하둡) 적극 지원, 접근하기 쉬워지고 널리 쓰이기 시작 | SQL 기반의 데이터는 거의 행렬 형태로 정형화된 데이터였으나 일반 문서(웹 문서) 등과 같이 비정형화 데이터도 초점 . | 데이터를 저장만 해서는 쓸모가 없음 | 데이터를 읽어들이고 변환하고 핵심을 추출하는 것도 마찬가지고 컴퓨터 1대로 할 수 있는 것보다 훨씬 빨라져야 함 | 맵리듀스 (MapReduce) : 분산 데이터 처리 | 현재는 스파크 (Apache Spark) 가 널리 쓰임 | . GFS(Google File System) 논문 (2003) . 막대한 양의 웹 문서를 저장 조회해야 하는데, 컴퓨터 1대로는 당연히 처리가 불가능 | 저렴한 하드웨어를 사용하면서, 대신 중복저장을 통해 파일 유실을 방지 | 파일을 새로 추가하는데 집중, 삭제나 파일 덮어쓰기는 어려움 | Latency보다 Throughput을 중시 | 클러스터 갯수를 늘릴수록 저장용량과 throughput이 점점 올라감 | 여러 컴퓨터를 연결하여 저장용량과 I/O 성능을 scale | 이를 구현한 오픈소스 프로젝트인 Hadoop HDFS | . MapReduce 논문 (2004) . Google MapReduce (2004) | 여러대의 분산 저장소에 존재하는 데이터를 변환하거나 계산하기 위한 프레임 워크 | Functional Programming의 Map() 함수와 Reduce() 함수를 조합하여 효율적으로 분산 환경에서 다양한 계산을 함 | Map과 Reduce 연산을 조합하여 클러스터에서 실행, 큰 데이터를 처리 | 이를 구현한 오픈소스 프로젝트인 Hadoop MapReduce | . Hadoop . GPS(2003)과 MapReduce(2004) 논뭉를 보고, Doug Cutting과 Mike Cafarella가 이를 오픈소스로 구현 | 야후에서 프로젝트를 하던 중 그 한 부분으로 만듬, 이후 오픈소스로 공개 (2006) | Hadoop : 아들의 노란 코끼리 장난감의 이름을 따 만듬 | . Hive . SQL로 분석 쿼리를 실행하면, 이를 MapReduce 코드로 변환해주는 도구 | MapReduce 코드는 작성하기 아주 불편하므로 큰 인기를 끔 | 쿼리로 MapReduce의 거의 모든 기능을 표현할 수 있다 | HDFS등에 있는 파일을 읽어들여 쿼리로 분석 수행 | HiveQL을 작성하면 MapReduce 코드로 변환되어 실행 | . 그렇게 10년이 지나고, 지금까지도 MapReduce와 Hive는 많이 사용되고 있는 빅데이터 기술입니다 MR, Hive에 도전하는 기술들 Impala, Pheonix, Pig, Tez 등등 . 하둡 생태계의 많은 프로젝트들 . pig . Pig Latin이라는 하이레벨 언어로 MapReduce를 실행할 수 있는 도구 | Netflix 등에서 사용하면서 주목을 받았고, 현재는 거의 사용되지 않음 | . Tez . MapReduce의 성능적, 표현적 한계를 극복하고자 하는 실행엔진 | Spark의 급부상으로 거의 주목을 받지 못함 | . Impala . MapReduce 기반의 Hive의 느린 응답성을 개선한 도구 | Spark의 급부상으로 (Spark SQL) 초기에 약간 주목을 받다가 현재는 거의 사용되지 않음 | . MapReduce/Hive 장단점 . 장점 . 빅데이터 시대를 열어준 선구적인 기술 | 거대한 데이터를 안정적으로 처리 | 많은 사람드이 사용 중 | . 단점 . 오래된 기술이다 보니, | 발전이 느리다 | 불편한 점이 많다 | . MapReduce의 문제점 . MapReduce는 Map의 입출력 및 Reduce의 입출력 및 Reduce의 입출력을 매번 HDFS에 쓰고 읽는다 - 느리다 | MapReduce 코드는 작성하기 불편하다 - 좀 더 좋은 인터페이스가 있으면 좋겠다 | . Apache Spark . 비교적 최근에 (2012) 등장하여 선풍적인 인기를 얻고 있는 분산처리 프레임워크 | 메모리 기반의 처리를 통한 고성능과 Functional Programming 인터페이스를 활용한 편리한 인터페이스가 특징 | 핵심 개념 : RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) | 인터페이스 : Scala | 인메모리, 메모리 상에 데이터를 올려 놓은 상태로 데이터 처리 | . 단순한 연산인 경우 데이터를 읽고 연산하는 방식이 나쁘지 않지만 반복연산일 수록 효율이 떨어진다. 다단계의 연산이나 반복 연산의 경우 중간 결과를 메모리에 저장하면 매번 디스크에 쓰는 것보다 훨씬 빠르다 . RDD . Resilient Distributed Dataset - 탄력적으로 분산된 데이터셋 오류 자동복구 기능이 포함된 가상의 리스트 | 다양한 계산을 수행 가능, 메모리를 활용하여 높은 성능을 지님 | . | 클러스터에 분산된 메모리를 활용하여 계산되는 List | 데이터를 어떻게 구해낼지를 표현하는 Transformation을 기술한 Lineage(계보)를 interactive하게 만들어 낸 후, Action을 통해 lazy하게 값을 구해냄 | 클러스터 중 일부의 고장등으로 작업이 중간에 실패하더라도, Lineage를 통해 데이터를 복구 | . Interface - Scala . 매우 간결한 표현이 가능한 모던 프로그래밍 언어 | REPL(aka Shell) 제공, interactive하게 데이터를 다루는 것이 가능 | Functional Programming이 가능하므로 MapReduce와 같은 functional한 개념을 표현하기에 적합함 | . val file = spark.textFile(&quot;hdfs://...&quot;) val counts = file.flatMap(line =&gt; line.split(&quot; &quot;)) .map(word = word, 1) .reduceByKey(_ + _) counts.saveAsTextFile(&quot;hdfs://...&quot;) . 확장 프로젝트들 . Spark SQL : Hive와 비슷하게 SQL로 데이터 분석 | Spark Streaming : 실시간 분석 | MLlib : 머신러닝 라이브러리 | GraphX : 페이지랭크같은 그래프 분석 | SparkR | Zeppelin | . 장점들 . 시간과 비용을 아껴준다 . 수십대의 Hadoop Cluster를 10대 이하의 Cluster로 대체할 수 있다 | 수십분 기다려야 하던 작업이 1분만에 완료된다 | . 작업 능률 향상 . MR 작업 코드 만들고, 패키징하고, submit하고 하던 복잡한 과정이, shell에서 코드 한줄 치는 것으로 대체된다 | 처음 접하는 사람도 배우기 쉽다 | . 다양한 제품을 조합해야 했던 작업이 Spark으로 다 가능하다 .",
